[25/06/2012 7:35:51] me: i'm more a shooter player
[25/06/2012 7:36:00] me: that's why i play on a pc

[25/06/2012 7:36:30] other: Heh that's cool - I play some shooters from time to time but not so much any more.

[25/06/2012 7:37:56] other: I have not played that. Does it have Mac version?
[25/06/2012 7:38:02] me: i think it does

[25/06/2012 7:38:33] other: Hrm, yeah, may not be great on current machine. I need to upgrade eventually but so expensive when you get 27 inch models :D
[25/06/2012 7:38:44] other: But 21 seems too small now as I am used to it.
[25/06/2012 7:38:48] other: At the office they have 30 inch ones.

[25/06/2012 7:39:37] other: I might get a PC again one day.
[25/06/2012 7:39:42] other: But seems like a lot of space for just games.
[25/06/2012 7:39:49] other: Just because I don't have much time for games anyway right now ^-^;
[25/06/2012 7:39:55] other: What time do you have to go to work?
[25/06/2012 7:40:12] me: almost now, need to shave and have a shower first
[25/06/2012 7:40:37] other: That is a shame but I have to go make a call in a minute anyway and I am glad I got to talk to you :)

[26/06/2012 6:34:53] other: I wouldn't like it because it would be sticky ^-^;
[26/06/2012 6:34:56] other: But still very funny.
[26/06/2012 6:35:06] other: I hate sticky things spilling.
[26/06/2012 6:35:12] me: hahahaha that's the best part!
[26/06/2012 6:35:24] me: now I can hug you and you won't be able to escape

[26/06/2012 6:35:52] other: Hahahahaha
[26/06/2012 6:35:58] other: I would be all stickkkkky though.
[26/06/2012 6:36:05] other: It might attract ants!
[26/06/2012 6:36:16] me: no way
[26/06/2012 6:36:25] me: I'll stick with you to protect you

[26/06/2012 6:37:15] other: Heh, good - you can stomp them for me :)
[26/06/2012 6:37:28] other: I just told Carlos this about cat here, I copy paste it for you;
I was sitting on couch and put a cig in my mouth as was going to go outside for one, but put it in my mouth inside, he came up and sat on my lap, looking at me - then using a paw either side he snatched the cig right out of my mouth :D
[26/06/2012 6:38:06] me: hahahaha
[26/06/2012 6:38:10] me: anti smoking cat
[26/06/2012 6:38:15] me: well trained by your mother
[26/06/2012 6:38:18] me: xD
[26/06/2012 6:38:50] other: Haha
[26/06/2012 6:38:57] other: He is a funny cat but a bit mean.
[26/06/2012 6:39:07] other: I try to be nice to him but he doesn't like me much.
[26/06/2012 6:39:36] me: well
[26/06/2012 6:39:48] me: better that way xD I'm allergic to cats
[26/06/2012 6:39:59] other: Oh that is a shame, they can be lovely.
[26/06/2012 6:40:03] other: But so can dogs :)
[26/06/2012 6:40:08] other: Do you like dogs?
[26/06/2012 6:40:10] me: yeah always had dogs
[26/06/2012 6:40:15] me: love them A LOT
[26/06/2012 6:40:27] other: Do you have a favorite kind?
[26/06/2012 6:40:33] me: yes
[26/06/2012 6:40:48] me: the one I loved the most and has been more trusty for me
[26/06/2012 6:40:55] me: let me search for a photo
[26/06/2012 6:41:17] me: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__ePjErwy054/S-EP19RJJ7I/AAAAAAAABZ0/xjurt0Dfvbg/s1600/cocker-spaniel.jpg
[26/06/2012 6:41:36] other: That is very cute :)
[26/06/2012 6:41:44] me: mine was a girl
[26/06/2012 6:41:56] me: the most beer loving dog you could ever see
[26/06/2012 6:42:02] other: Hahahaha
[26/06/2012 6:42:24] other: I had a Jack Russel (girl) who loved eating cigarettes for some reason.
[26/06/2012 6:42:30] me: hahahaha
[26/06/2012 6:42:41] me: I had mine when she was 2 weeks
[26/06/2012 6:42:54] me: living in a shoe box for some months in my room
[26/06/2012 6:43:07] me: he learned to enjoy rock music and beer
[26/06/2012 6:43:15] other: Hehe, that is cute ^-^;
[26/06/2012 6:43:16] me: she
[26/06/2012 6:43:41] other: I knew you meant "she" ;)
[26/06/2012 6:43:44] me: yeah and having her when she was so little, she treated me like her father
[26/06/2012 6:44:12] me: always obedient and waiting for me
[26/06/2012 6:44:30] other: I miss Minnie, the dog from Sydney who would visit.
[26/06/2012 6:44:36] other: She was like that, very good dog.
[26/06/2012 6:44:46] me: I remember Minnie
[26/06/2012 6:44:54] me: you made a very touching video
[26/06/2012 6:44:59] me: will never forget it
[26/06/2012 6:45:21] other: Heh, yes, she visited me a few days before I left.
[26/06/2012 6:45:35] other: I hope she goes OK, am sure she will, but will miss her.
[26/06/2012 6:46:11] other: My ex's tooth broke yesterday too - I am not happy about that. I have to help him pay for it. >.<'
[26/06/2012 6:46:46] me: can I say something even if it has nothing to do with me?
[26/06/2012 6:47:02] other: Yes. Although I can guess what ^-^;
[26/06/2012 6:47:16] me: well you told me you'll still send him money
[26/06/2012 6:47:19] me: for food
[26/06/2012 6:47:24] me: and now that...
[26/06/2012 6:47:30] me: I don't get why
[26/06/2012 6:48:00] other: Well, it's complicated - I love him very much, I've been responsible for him a long time. It is kind of like having a child.
[26/06/2012 6:48:13] other: I couldn't give him nothing knowing he would have no food.
[26/06/2012 6:48:21] other: And I can't leave him with a broken tooth in pain knowingly.
[26/06/2012 6:48:44] other: I would be the same if I had another friend in that situation I cared a lot about - but especially him as he is like family, I looked after him so long.
[26/06/2012 6:48:51] other: It's like if you had a pet that needed to go to the vet XD
[26/06/2012 6:49:04] me: yeah i get it
[26/06/2012 6:49:06] me: but
[26/06/2012 6:49:21] me: do you realise this can't be forever right?
[26/06/2012 6:49:36] me: at some point he'll have to make money on his own
[26/06/2012 6:49:47] me: and that will be good for him
[26/06/2012 6:49:49] other: Do you know what "alimony" is in America?
[26/06/2012 6:50:03] me: nope
[26/06/2012 6:50:21] other: You know how sometimes when people divorce one person has to pay the other money regularly?
[26/06/2012 6:50:21] me: now I know
[26/06/2012 6:50:23] me: wikipedia
[26/06/2012 6:50:44] me: yeah I know that
[26/06/2012 6:50:59] other: OK well this is a bit like that.
[26/06/2012 6:51:18] other: Dex and I were together for a long time and we were "common law married" - what that means is even though we weren't married the state recognized us as a couple.
[26/06/2012 6:51:28] other: So when we separated is like a divorce in many ways.
[26/06/2012 6:51:50] other: He could have gotten money if he wanted to anyway by taking me to court.
[26/06/2012 6:52:14] other: He's never do that but he could, because the law says if one person provides for the other and they divorce/separate that they should continue helping.
[26/06/2012 6:52:40] other: But, ultimately, it is just that I know right now if I did not help he would starve and be in pain with his tooth.
[26/06/2012 6:52:50] other: You know me, I am sensitive and kind, I could not have that.
[26/06/2012 6:52:55] me: true
[26/06/2012 6:53:00] me: I understand you
[26/06/2012 6:53:13] other: I would do the same for others I care about too - it is not a romantic gesture.
[26/06/2012 6:53:30] other: If you broke a tooth and couldn't afford to have it fixed, or you had no food, I would help you also.
[26/06/2012 6:53:35] me: but if you keep some contact with him you should make him wanting to get money on his own too
[26/06/2012 6:53:58] other: We keep contact and I will keep encouraging him, yes.
[26/06/2012 6:54:01] me: I know I can't say that well but pretty sure you'll get my point too
[26/06/2012 6:54:13] other: I know what you mean :)
[26/06/2012 6:54:30] other: Kindly don't repeat any of that, I don't want most people knowing as they wouldn't understand the situation so well.
[26/06/2012 6:54:34] other: (I know it is unusual situation.)
[26/06/2012 6:54:47] me: I even asked you to talk about it...
[26/06/2012 6:54:54] me: it's your private matters
[26/06/2012 6:55:09] me: I can say my opinion to you, nothing else
[26/06/2012 6:55:16] other: I don't mind talking to you about it :)
[26/06/2012 6:55:20] me: not even wanted to influence you in any way
[26/06/2012 6:55:30] other: Or your opinion - its all good :)
[26/06/2012 6:55:44] me: so don't worry, if someone knows it will be cos you tell him/her
[26/06/2012 6:56:01] other: I know you don't try to influence, we just talk - and I know you respect my privacy.
[26/06/2012 6:56:28] me: no harm in remembering from time to time just in case xD
[26/06/2012 6:56:44] other: Haha it's fine to remind me but don't worry, I know :)
[26/06/2012 6:56:58] me: ^_^
[26/06/2012 6:57:06] me: I looove your smile on the new pic

[26/06/2012 6:58:04] other: Haha I am a workaholic I know ^-^
[26/06/2012 6:58:06] me: hahahaha
[26/06/2012 6:58:21] me: yeah well... the scarf is a little more 'personal' gift
[26/06/2012 6:58:34] me: maybe some followers would get upset
[26/06/2012 6:58:53] other: Haha they would be unhappy I was closer to you, yes.
[26/06/2012 6:59:03] me: but
[26/06/2012 6:59:09] me: do we mind about that?
[26/06/2012 6:59:25] other: No, to some extent is ok now I think.
[26/06/2012 6:59:37] other: I don't mind if w sees we are good friends.
[26/06/2012 6:59:44] me: ^_^
[26/06/2012 6:59:45] other: Or others

[26/06/2012 7:05:16] me: xD
[26/06/2012 7:05:25] me: it'll be funny to make him crazy
[26/06/2012 7:05:38] other: He may not say anything, he doesn't always like challenging me - but yes, he will certainly not like it ;)
[26/06/2012 7:05:59] me: well he is about to kill the tool we loved so much...
[26/06/2012 7:06:10] other: I know. He is an ass.
[26/06/2012 7:06:13] me: fair play
[26/06/2012 7:06:23] me: asses must have a kick
[26/06/2012 7:06:30] other: Hah, true
[26/06/2012 7:06:37] me: and if the kicker is a karate girl haha!
[26/06/2012 7:06:44] me: the harder the kick will be

[26/06/2012 7:09:12] me: you know... judo, what i did isn't about hits right?
[26/06/2012 7:09:22] me: it's about taking the other one to the floor
[26/06/2012 7:09:37] other: Yes, I have some idea about judo :)
[26/06/2012 7:09:42] me: well
[26/06/2012 7:09:55] me: I see some 'connecting the dots' here...
[26/06/2012 7:10:12] me: you were meant to kick asses fro the beggining
[26/06/2012 7:10:26] me: and i was meant to lay on the floor with someone xD
[26/06/2012 7:10:36] other: Hahahaha

[26/06/2012 7:12:02] me: it's way better for me than 3 hours earlier like I was doing before
[26/06/2012 7:12:13] other: I don't mind that, this is a more likely time to see me anyway :)
[26/06/2012 7:12:29] me: nice
[26/06/2012 7:12:37] other: Do you have to go to work now/soon?
[26/06/2012 7:12:44] me: I can't promise I'll make something blow up again for your enjoyment
[26/06/2012 7:12:56] me: not soon, still almost an hour
[26/06/2012 7:13:17] other: Sorry my sister was lingering trying to read my screen.
[26/06/2012 7:13:21] other: XD I hate it when people do that.
[26/06/2012 7:13:25] me: hahahaha

[26/06/2012 7:16:39] me: how is your work with the dark side going?
[26/06/2012 7:17:00] other: Right now I have had a brief break due to move, I hope to go further into it soon.
[26/06/2012 7:17:07] other: Assuming dark side is corona competitors :P
[26/06/2012 7:17:26] me: oh I didn't say anything, assume what you think fits ;)
[26/06/2012 7:17:34] me: but really
[26/06/2012 7:17:46] me: I talked with Carlos about this...
[26/06/2012 7:17:56] me: We are both worried
[26/06/2012 7:18:07] other: What about exactly?
[26/06/2012 7:18:31] me: about you must get ready for when w pushes the red button
[26/06/2012 7:18:35] me: and everything explodes
[26/06/2012 7:18:59] me: I can see a company sell or something like that when they don't meet expectations
[26/06/2012 7:19:28] other: Lol were you talking about how I have to prepare? ^-^;
[26/06/2012 7:19:52] other: I know about that, having to prepare, I've made a start and will continue to do more. I just had a few little interuptions due to sudden move.
[26/06/2012 7:20:05] me: yeah about that
[26/06/2012 7:20:28] me: I know and you know I trust you'll be ready when the time comes
[26/06/2012 7:20:36] me: but still afraid
[26/06/2012 7:20:49] me: that you maybe won't have the time you expect to have
[26/06/2012 7:21:07] other: I am too but not that afraid - I am resilient and resourceful.
[26/06/2012 7:21:16] other: I do not "expect" any time, trust me.
[26/06/2012 7:21:30] other: It could fall apart tomorrow and I'd still find a way to be cool.
[26/06/2012 7:21:43] other: I have survived worse things than this ;)
[26/06/2012 7:21:55] me: ok
[26/06/2012 7:21:59] me: but you know it
[26/06/2012 7:22:03] me: the ceo and me are here
[26/06/2012 7:22:08] me: for whatever you need
[26/06/2012 7:22:29] other: I know it is stressful and I have to prepare, Carlos always tells me to prepare - it'll be cool.
[26/06/2012 7:22:36] other: Thank you :) I know and am very glad of that.
[26/06/2012 7:22:53] other: It has been nice having both of you to chat to with so much going on professionally and personally.
[26/06/2012 7:23:16] me: hey we are your extended family

[26/06/2012 7:27:00] other: Here is pretty good, be clean later, right now a bag or two are around and two boxes but fairly neat still.

[27/06/2012 6:14:36] me: anyway xD
[27/06/2012 6:14:52] other: It has to do with where you are on the planet :P I can't help that. Yet. When I rule the world I will :)

[27/06/2012 6:29:29] other: I see. I am sorry your boss is an ass. I know how that is, except that w isn't ever really going to be my boss ;)
[27/06/2012 6:29:35] other: He should like that. What an idiot.
[27/06/2012 6:29:51] me: yeah well but since I'm there some things came up to light
[27/06/2012 6:30:09] me: and people have started to notice maybe he wasn't as busy as he always says

[27/06/2012 6:31:59] other: It sounds like a tricky situation. What are your plans for it?
[27/06/2012 6:32:10] me: well
[27/06/2012 6:32:15] me: I can't do a direct attack

[27/06/2012 6:32:39] me: let's see if he can keep my timings
[27/06/2012 6:33:00] me: my plans are working as harder as ever until he simply surrenders
[27/06/2012 6:33:10] other: Hehe

[27/06/2012 6:39:06] me: x++: server side code
[27/06/2012 6:39:21] other: I don't know any of those things ;)

[27/06/2012 6:42:21] me: thought it could be cos you were doing something interesting ^_^
[27/06/2012 6:42:30] other: I wanted to post a short tutorial I wrote while I was on the plane coming here :)
[27/06/2012 6:42:36] other: I was tired but figured was worth doing.
[27/06/2012 6:42:45] other: So not fun but productive at least ;)

[27/06/2012 6:43:13] other: Really basic stuff but lots of people don't understand it.
[27/06/2012 6:43:20] other: So I thought would be a good newbie one.
[27/06/2012 6:43:30] me: I know, loops and tables are noob killers
[27/06/2012 6:43:51] other: Heh, I like them now I understand them.
[27/06/2012 6:43:58] other: They were one of the things I didn't learn for ages though.
[27/06/2012 6:44:13] me: :) they're sooo useful
[27/06/2012 6:44:29] me: and also the easiest way to break an app
[27/06/2012 6:44:55] me: while true do print('shit'); end;
[27/06/2012 6:45:03] other: heh
[27/06/2012 6:45:04] me: and all of a sudden your covered in shit
[27/06/2012 6:45:05] me: xD

[27/06/2012 6:45:14] other: So true
[27/06/2012 6:45:42] other: Question, does JavaScript have an official logo of some kind?
[27/06/2012 6:46:02] other: Am trying to find something to customize a folder with. (Custom icons help me find things easier when desktop is crowded, haha.)
[27/06/2012 6:46:03] me: I think the same as Java itself
[27/06/2012 6:46:06] me: the coffee
[27/06/2012 6:46:25] other: Oh yeah maybe I have seen that before. Hrm. *goooooooogles!*
[27/06/2012 6:46:42] me: http://unmapa.webcindario.com/images/java_coffee.png
[27/06/2012 6:46:58] other: That is not a very pretty icon.
[27/06/2012 6:47:02] me: xDDD
[27/06/2012 6:47:04] other: It would not look pretty on a folder.
[27/06/2012 6:47:09] other: :P
[27/06/2012 6:47:24] other: But thank you for link... I just have to find a prettier one ;)
[27/06/2012 6:47:34] me: http://icongal.com/gallery/image/191744/folder_java_coffee_drink_meal_food.png
[27/06/2012 6:47:45] other: Ooooh I like it!

[27/06/2012 6:47:55] other: Thank you, I will use that :)
[27/06/2012 6:48:04] other: That one is cool too
[27/06/2012 6:48:19] other: I think the first is cooler though, writing on cup would be too small on icon I *think*
[27/06/2012 6:48:26] other: *saves both anyway* :)
[27/06/2012 6:48:28] me: :)
[27/06/2012 6:48:47] me: haven't you thought in calling the folder JAVASCRIPT?
[27/06/2012 6:48:50] me: xD
[27/06/2012 6:49:03] other: XD
[27/06/2012 6:49:05] other: I did that!
[27/06/2012 6:49:14] other: It's just my desktop gets super crowded :P
[27/06/2012 6:49:21] other: I lose things if they don't have icons I know to look for.
[27/06/2012 6:49:24] other: Saves time :D

[27/06/2012 6:50:59] other: I was a pretty cute baby - I had black hair as a baby, it went lighter as soon as I got to be a little older and was blonde until I was about 12 when it went a little darker to how it is now.
[27/06/2012 6:51:15] other: It would stand up like a little mohawk a lot of the time :D

[27/06/2012 6:54:40] other: I want a nap but also want to work as always ;)
[27/06/2012 6:55:01] me: eventually you'll be able to do both at a time
[27/06/2012 6:55:14] other: Haha I would like that :D
[27/06/2012 6:55:28] me: have you never solved a problem while sleeping?
[27/06/2012 6:55:36] me: i mean a code problem
[27/06/2012 6:55:47] other: I have-
[27/06/2012 6:55:51] other: But often I forget it when I wake up.
[27/06/2012 6:55:54] other: As in exact logic ;)
[27/06/2012 6:56:01] me: hahaha
[27/06/2012 6:56:16] me: well the only thing left is remembering it then
[27/06/2012 6:56:24] me: it happens a lot to me...
[27/06/2012 6:56:29] other: Do you remember mostly?
[27/06/2012 6:56:34] me: yeah

[27/06/2012 6:56:43] me: xD
[27/06/2012 6:56:52] other: Hahaha
[27/06/2012 6:57:18] me: you can see me crawling in bed while saying stupid things like: not that way you fool, it will crash!
[27/06/2012 6:57:24] me: yeah put this on there
[27/06/2012 6:57:27] me: and so on...
[27/06/2012 6:57:32] other: LOL :D
[27/06/2012 6:57:34] me: they i wake up and I just let it go
[27/06/2012 6:57:56] other: I say things like "It's not a bug in Corona, it is in your code!"
[27/06/2012 6:58:00] other: XD
[27/06/2012 6:58:06] me: HAHAHAHAHA
[27/06/2012 6:58:15] other: Sometimes I say it loudly enough to wake myself up. Am not joking :D
[27/06/2012 6:58:37] me: Ha! and what about Inneractive???!!!
[27/06/2012 6:58:40] me: everyone lied to me
[27/06/2012 6:58:52] me: W, David, Orly from Inneractive...
[27/06/2012 6:58:57] other: Huh?
[27/06/2012 6:59:09] me: every fucking one I asked lied and told me the bug was from the other one
[27/06/2012 6:59:29] other: It *was* an inneractive bug, just so you know.
[27/06/2012 6:59:52] me: I know, but they made me go round and round
[27/06/2012 6:59:55] other: However it should have been fixed like a week ago - inneractive fixed it then but corona needed to implement it in the SDK.
[27/06/2012 7:00:09] other: So yeah, it wasn't fixed when it should have been so now is c-labs fault too.
[27/06/2012 7:00:20] other: People tend to do that sometimes XD I know.
[27/06/2012 7:00:54] me: it's funny you wake up yelling at noobs
[27/06/2012 7:00:56] me: :D
[27/06/2012 7:01:14] other: Is it fixed now, do you know?
[27/06/2012 7:01:20] other: I am not up to date on anything this week.
[27/06/2012 7:01:27] me: internet off?
[27/06/2012 7:02:39] other: Sorry, internet went weird again - same time as yesterday roughly I think.
[27/06/2012 7:02:59] other: Hah - messages just came through - yes - internet XD
[27/06/2012 7:03:13] me: really? it is fixed? no one told me...
[27/06/2012 7:03:16] other: I do wake up yelling at noobs because I am so nice to them I have hidden frustrations haha
[27/06/2012 7:03:52] other: Sorry, it did it again.
[27/06/2012 7:04:00] other: I don't know if it is fixed.

[29/06/2012 6:36:50] other: Give it a month or two, will be much longer - and when it is straighter after my wash it will look longer too.
[29/06/2012 6:36:53] other: Hahahaha
[29/06/2012 6:37:06] other: Do you not like the style or just that it is much shorter now?

[29/06/2012 6:38:23] other: At the ends you mean?
[29/06/2012 6:38:28] me: yeah
[29/06/2012 6:38:39] other: That will be less once it is straighter.
[29/06/2012 6:38:50] other: She dried it in a way that made it puffier so it flips out more.
[29/06/2012 6:38:51] other: :)

[29/06/2012 6:47:53] other: That isn't good :(
[29/06/2012 6:48:10] me: I can't make a big process to update everything, different kinds of pieces need different calculations
[29/06/2012 6:48:35] me: so it's like code, take a report, make comparison, code more, next one
[29/06/2012 6:48:48] other: That sucjs :(

[01/07/2012 7:15:41] me: but one thing I may need you for is a letter
[01/07/2012 7:15:51] other: XD Why do you need a whole bucket of money? You mean it's an expensive trip? Or do they want you to have money to come in?
[01/07/2012 7:16:01] other: Ah yes a letter inviting you to visit or something, right?
[01/07/2012 7:16:09] me: 4000 euros just to go there
[01/07/2012 7:16:12] me: yeah, that
[01/07/2012 7:16:31] other: Yeah it isn't that cheap, same as me going there.
[01/07/2012 7:16:39] me: then when I'll get there I'll be poor and unable to come back, so treat me well xD
[01/07/2012 7:17:39] me: I'll have to wait until your government takes me out of the country if I want to come back haha
[01/07/2012 7:17:56] other: Hahahaha
[01/07/2012 7:18:02] other: That is not such a good idea XD
[01/07/2012 7:18:14] other: You don't want to get stuck in a foreign country even if it is where I live :D
[01/07/2012 7:18:15] me: yeah well
[01/07/2012 7:18:20] me: but it may work
[01/07/2012 7:18:41] other: How would it work? If they have to kick you out they will not be happy :D
[01/07/2012 7:19:08] me: what's the worst they can do?
[01/07/2012 7:19:28] me: prohibiting me to come back?
[01/07/2012 7:19:31] other: Well if you get kicked out of a country they can put a ban on you so you can't reenter the country for a long time.
[01/07/2012 7:19:32] other: Yeah.
[01/07/2012 7:19:44] me: then next time you come here
[01/07/2012 7:19:45] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:19:50] other: Plus you can't just stay here indefinitely, you have a job ^-^;
[01/07/2012 7:20:07] me: oh that's easier
[01/07/2012 7:20:20] me: some key developments depend on me right now
[01/07/2012 7:20:36] me: so if they want to keep them working, let me work remotely
[01/07/2012 7:20:40] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:20:55] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 7:21:20] other: Maybe yes, they would do that.
[01/07/2012 7:21:35] other: But still you can't be trapped in another country :D What about friends and family?
[01/07/2012 7:21:48] me: :)
[01/07/2012 7:21:51] me: they love me
[01/07/2012 7:22:03] me: and they want me to finally reach you
[01/07/2012 7:22:24] other: Heh, well, it's nice they are supportive but still - you don't want to get kicked out of Australia :D
[01/07/2012 7:22:35] me: I think they are all sicked of hearing me talk about you
[01/07/2012 7:22:45] me: so better send me there and forget about me in a while
[01/07/2012 7:22:45] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:23:03] me: sick, not sicked, right?
[01/07/2012 7:23:12] other: That is right, "sick" :D
[01/07/2012 7:23:44] me: please if it doesn't bother you too much, help me when I make some mistake
[01/07/2012 7:23:52] me: I want to speak better
[01/07/2012 7:24:01] other: I don't mind correcting your English if you wish - although it is very rare you make a mistake :)
[01/07/2012 7:24:27] me: just in case, I'd hate being unable to talk with you properly
[01/07/2012 7:24:42] other: I will but don't worry about it :) You talk just fine.
[01/07/2012 7:24:54] me: a friend told me there are some cheap flights
[01/07/2012 7:24:57] me: 900 euros
[01/07/2012 7:25:10] me: with a stop on hong kong
[01/07/2012 7:25:45] me: I have to find the airline yet
[01/07/2012 7:25:55] me: but if it exists that would be the right one
[01/07/2012 7:26:01] other: I don't know if that is a good deal or not, I should look it up.
[01/07/2012 7:26:10] other: Do you have sites like webjet there? They are good for comparing costs.
[01/07/2012 7:26:15] me: if it doesn't crash it's good enough
[01/07/2012 7:26:26] other: Haha :D
[01/07/2012 7:26:26] me: yeah some
[01/07/2012 7:26:57] me: I'm looking every day don't worry
[01/07/2012 7:27:03] me: I'll eventually find a right one
[01/07/2012 7:27:16] other: I wonder if it's the same price going from here to there.
[01/07/2012 7:27:36] other: How many euros is it one way/both ways?
[01/07/2012 7:27:55] me: didn't get that sorry?
[01/07/2012 7:28:10] other: How many euros does it cost to fly to Australia from there?
[01/07/2012 7:28:11] other: And
[01/07/2012 7:28:17] me: 4000
[01/07/2012 7:28:21] other: How many euros is it for a "return trip" - is that 4000?
[01/07/2012 7:28:30] other: Or is 4000 only one way?
[01/07/2012 7:28:33] me: still not looked into that
[01/07/2012 7:28:37] me: only one way
[01/07/2012 7:28:40] other: Wow
[01/07/2012 7:28:43] me: yeah
[01/07/2012 7:28:44] me: wow
[01/07/2012 7:28:45] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:28:49] other: That's really expensive.
[01/07/2012 7:28:55] other: I think it is about half that for my to fly there.
[01/07/2012 7:29:04] me: that's why I'm not planning my return
[01/07/2012 7:29:05] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:29:12] me: I won't be able to plan it
[01/07/2012 7:29:16] me: no matter what
[01/07/2012 7:29:29] other: It seems like WAY too much money.
[01/07/2012 7:29:34] me: nah
[01/07/2012 7:29:38] other: It's crazy XD
[01/07/2012 7:29:40] me: nothing is too expensive
[01/07/2012 7:29:55] other: It seems so unfair compared to price of flying from here to there.
[01/07/2012 7:30:19] me: but I'm a gentlegeek...
[01/07/2012 7:30:27] me: I can't ask you to come first
[01/07/2012 7:30:47] other: Hah, true, but we should think about it.
[01/07/2012 7:31:08] other: If I plan on visiting America again any time soon then it is a direct flight from SFO to Barcelona I think. And not so expensive.
[01/07/2012 7:31:12] me: and I'll happily throw my actual life to the toilet if I can see you only a minute...
[01/07/2012 7:31:25] other: Hah well I could never let you do that ^-^;
[01/07/2012 7:31:45] me: ok
[01/07/2012 7:31:46] other: You must take good care of your life :)
[01/07/2012 7:31:49] me: two minutes then
[01/07/2012 7:31:51] me: :D
[01/07/2012 7:31:52] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 7:31:55] other: Not that either! :P
[01/07/2012 7:32:05] me: wow, are you giving me a whole hour?
[01/07/2012 7:32:08] other: I will be back in a minute, need a cig finally now after eating breakfast.
[01/07/2012 7:32:09] other: LOL
[01/07/2012 7:32:10] me: I can do wonders with that
[01/07/2012 7:32:10] other: :P
[01/07/2012 7:32:11] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:32:20] other: Take care of your life while I am gone :P haha
[01/07/2012 7:32:24] other: brb
[01/07/2012 7:32:27] me: I will :*
[01/07/2012 7:36:11] me: making cofee, will be back in no time!
[01/07/2012 7:37:59] other: Back :)
[01/07/2012 7:38:42] me: me too
[01/07/2012 7:38:51] other: :)
[01/07/2012 7:38:55] me: how is the weather there today?
[01/07/2012 7:39:05] other: Cold, I wear my scarf when I go outside :)
[01/07/2012 7:39:15] other: It helps even more now I have short hair ^-^;
[01/07/2012 7:39:22] me: ^_^
[01/07/2012 7:39:58] other: But yes, with the trip, we should think about it a bit. If I plan on traveling before long anyway it may work better if I visit you.
[01/07/2012 7:39:58] me: sorry that made me blush...
[01/07/2012 7:40:03] other: Hah :D
[01/07/2012 7:40:19] me: hmmm....
[01/07/2012 7:40:35] me: well
[01/07/2012 7:40:40] other: We don't know quite yet what my travel plans are, I know I want to go back to SF sometime before too long to see Carlos and others.
[01/07/2012 7:40:48] other: And yeah, it is direct flight from there to you.
[01/07/2012 7:40:50] me: I'll keep filling forms anyway
[01/07/2012 7:41:03] me: I want to be ready
[01/07/2012 7:41:12] me: and really, I don't mind about anything
[01/07/2012 7:41:17] me: I want to see you
[01/07/2012 7:41:29] me: I wanted to see you for so freaking long
[01/07/2012 7:41:33] other: I know, I want to see you too - I think it will be easier for me to make plans after a little more time.
[01/07/2012 7:41:40] other: I have also wanted to see you for a long time.
[01/07/2012 7:41:55] other: But yes, right now it's harder for me to make plans as obviously I have had an odd month.
[01/07/2012 7:41:56] me: :) if you want I can still move my holidays
[01/07/2012 7:42:09] other: Hah well we will see about that ^-^;
[01/07/2012 7:43:09] me: i just have 2 weeks but I have to quit, simulate illness or whatever, I'll do it
[01/07/2012 7:43:23] me: if I have to quit
[01/07/2012 7:43:25] other: Well we don't want that either ^-^;
[01/07/2012 7:43:32] other: You have a good job now and should try to keep it.
[01/07/2012 7:43:45] me: maybe you could hire me for techority xD
[01/07/2012 7:44:06] me: I'm cheap, a kiss and a twinkie at day
[01/07/2012 7:44:07] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:44:26] other: Haha well yes, that's one possibility :D
[01/07/2012 7:44:37] other: If I had a better job I wouldn't worry so much, although maybe I will by then.
[01/07/2012 7:44:45] other: Right now I do not earn enough money at all.
[01/07/2012 7:44:54] me: hmmm
[01/07/2012 7:44:58] other: I am very underpaid :D
[01/07/2012 7:45:14] me: then maybe it is better for you to come with shared expenses
[01/07/2012 7:45:29] me: if i keep my job i'll be able to help you in everything you need
[01/07/2012 7:45:31] me: :)
[01/07/2012 7:45:44] other: Maybe that is something we consider, yes :) That could make more sense.
[01/07/2012 7:45:54] me: but take notice of what i just said: SHARED EXPENSES
[01/07/2012 7:45:58] other: Especially because it is SO much more expensive for you to fly here.
[01/07/2012 7:46:00] me: i won't accept anything else
[01/07/2012 7:46:14] other: It depends what shared expenses means as to whether or not I'd let you :D
[01/07/2012 7:46:32] me: well... until I'm broke I pay
[01/07/2012 7:46:36] me: that kind
[01/07/2012 7:46:37] me: xD
[01/07/2012 7:46:40] other: Haha well we'll see about that :D
[01/07/2012 7:46:45] other: We have time to think about it.
[01/07/2012 7:46:55] other: I hope to be a little more stable and settled soon.
[01/07/2012 7:47:09] me: yeah, i just like to think on it a little everyday
[01/07/2012 7:47:18] other: That's cool, I understand that :)
[01/07/2012 7:47:26] me: you seem to be doing well in Adelaide, don't you?
[01/07/2012 7:47:40] other: I am doing OK but it's still hard for me, I was with my ex for a very long time.
[01/07/2012 7:47:49] other: It will take me some time to adjust and be OK with everything.
[01/07/2012 7:48:03] other: It's for the best but takes some time to adjust after being together for so long.
[01/07/2012 7:48:14] me: at least I see you smilig on photos now
[01/07/2012 7:48:19] other: Yes haha :D
[01/07/2012 7:48:25] me: long time since I haven't see you like that
[01/07/2012 7:48:37] other: Yes well I didn't smile so much before, no.
[01/07/2012 7:48:41] other: I had a lot more stress then.
[01/07/2012 7:49:03] me: so it's been for the best :)
[01/07/2012 7:49:38] me: it's not being so hard, you are very strong and doing very well
[01/07/2012 7:49:52] other: It is and I'm doing well overall but yes, it is very strange and new.
[01/07/2012 7:49:54] me: you trust your decision too
[01/07/2012 7:50:26] me: :) everything will be awesome I'm sure
[01/07/2012 7:50:40] other: It will be, I just need a little more time to feel like myself again, that's all :)
[01/07/2012 7:50:45] other: I am getting there slowly but surely.
[01/07/2012 7:50:58] me: and who is yourself?
[01/07/2012 7:51:17] other: Good question haha :D
[01/07/2012 7:51:26] me: try to answer ;)
[01/07/2012 7:51:43] other: Happy and less stressed, mostly - and not thinking about my ex too often.
[01/07/2012 7:51:45] other: That :)
[01/07/2012 7:52:14] me: I bet that'll be easier with another hand holding yours :)
[01/07/2012 7:52:56] me: BUT I'm not sending you just a hand! you'll have to see the whole me xD
[01/07/2012 7:53:05] other: Haha

[01/07/2012 12:02:41] me: I'm sweating anyway because of cleaning
[01/07/2012 12:02:46] me: but will be fresh in a minute
[01/07/2012 12:02:56] other: Are you going to go shower?

[01/07/2012 12:04:58] me: i'll catch you!
[01/07/2012 12:05:00] me: xD

[01/07/2012 12:05:13] other: But 7.5 hours later in the day, always.
[01/07/2012 12:05:21] other: You are 7.5 behind - until you catch up. :P
[01/07/2012 12:05:29] other: At least until Daylight Savings Time...
[01/07/2012 12:05:30] me: >.<
[01/07/2012 12:05:34] other: Then things will get confusing.
[01/07/2012 12:05:52] other: Ah, I have a phone call and must run for now.
[01/07/2012 12:05:56] me: I use the iphone clock as a simple way to know if I can annoy you or not xD
[01/07/2012 12:05:59] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 12:06:01] other: Good idea
[01/07/2012 12:06:05] me: :*
[01/07/2012 12:06:10] other: I will talk to you a bit later perhaps after your lunch?
[01/07/2012 12:06:17] other: Te amo mucho! Must run for now.
[01/07/2012 12:06:19] me: talk later then my love
[01/07/2012 15:39:52] me: pass me that
[01/07/2012 15:40:11] other: Right now this is the code I have, in total;

[01/07/2012 15:41:32] other: ;) Brb
[01/07/2012 15:41:52] me: don't know who Vic is but ok xD
[01/07/2012 15:49:28] other: Back :)
[01/07/2012 15:49:30] other: Vic is Mum's partner.
[01/07/2012 15:49:41] me: ok
[01/07/2012 15:49:44] other: He stole my lighter earlier and I'd been using a spare one.
[01/07/2012 15:49:45] me: check your email ;)
[01/07/2012 15:50:03] other: Let me test that :) Thanks.
[01/07/2012 15:50:48] me: the only thing remaining is to skip 'Pie' as it's showFirst is set to false
[01/07/2012 15:50:57] me: so must add an IF on the first loop
[01/07/2012 15:50:57] other: OK, then I just do my sort on namesTable I think.
[01/07/2012 15:51:09] other: I think I know what to do - one sec :)
[01/07/2012 15:51:11] other: We will see ;)
[01/07/2012 15:51:13] me: :)
[01/07/2012 15:52:24] other: Hrm no that wont work, my original plan, because they don't have the showFirst property any more.
[01/07/2012 15:52:38] me: make two tables then
[01/07/2012 15:52:44] me: one for the showfirsters
[01/07/2012 15:52:48] me: and one for the others
[01/07/2012 15:52:53] me: print the first table first

[01/07/2012 15:56:23] other: OK :D
[01/07/2012 15:56:34] me: you dont have to do two loops to fill both tables
[01/07/2012 15:56:42] me: just one loop and an IF inside
[01/07/2012 15:57:05] other: Haha good point
[01/07/2012 15:57:25] other: Thank you ;)
[01/07/2012 15:57:30] me: hi5 team!

[01/07/2012 15:59:29] other: Good haha
[01/07/2012 15:59:33] other: I worked it out on my own :D
[01/07/2012 15:59:44] me: so there is 11:30 pm ?
[01/07/2012 15:59:53] other: That is correct :D Well done!
[01/07/2012 16:00:02] me: ^_^
[01/07/2012 16:00:12] me: it's hard for me to think in the am/pm way
[01/07/2012 16:00:13] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:00:23] other: I am like that as well sometimes.
[01/07/2012 16:00:29] other: Night is normally better than morning.
[01/07/2012 16:01:12] me: it just depends on what time I can catch you
[01/07/2012 16:01:13] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:01:30] other: There, I credited you in the post too :)
[01/07/2012 16:01:42] me: hahaha let me check it out
[01/07/2012 16:01:58] other: I couldn't say you wrote it all ;)
[01/07/2012 16:02:02] other: But I gave you some credit.
[01/07/2012 16:02:28] me: you didn't have to
[01/07/2012 16:02:31] me: but THANKS!
[01/07/2012 16:02:38] other: Credit where credit is due :)
[01/07/2012 16:03:06] me: it's funny you call me Alex publicly
[01/07/2012 16:03:14] me: almost no one from the community knows me like that
[01/07/2012 16:03:15] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:03:21] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 16:03:29] other: Well, it would be weird calling you anything else to me now :D
[01/07/2012 16:03:44] me: I like it more than Alejandro believe me ;)
[01/07/2012 16:04:00] other: That is good to know because I have trouble pronouncing Alejandro ;)
[01/07/2012 16:04:04] me: but I find it really funny how english speakers say Alejandro
[01/07/2012 16:04:08] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:04:10] me: right
[01/07/2012 16:04:29] other: W said it during our 1:1 skype call last time, the day after he emailed you.
[01/07/2012 16:04:31] other: He sounded odd.
[01/07/2012 16:04:42] other: I tried to use that too rather than Alex at first so we sounded less "familiar".
[01/07/2012 16:04:47] me: thanks to Lady Gaga no one knows to say it right
[01/07/2012 16:04:50] other: But then I stopped and just started calling you "Alex" anyway.
[01/07/2012 16:05:01] other: Hahaha I have not heard too much Lady Gaga.
[01/07/2012 16:05:07] other: How is it said properly?
[01/07/2012 16:05:51] me: oooh
[01/07/2012 16:05:55] me: sounds sexy
[01/07/2012 16:05:57] me: http://translate.google.es/?hl=es&tab=wT#es|en|Alejandro
[01/07/2012 16:06:02] me: push the speaker
[01/07/2012 16:06:03] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:06:08] me: it says it right
[01/07/2012 16:06:11] me: and hot
[01/07/2012 16:06:13] me: hahahaha
[01/07/2012 16:06:23] other: Which speaker, the Spanish one, right?
[01/07/2012 16:06:27] me: yeah
[01/07/2012 16:06:34] other: I will try, lol.
[01/07/2012 16:06:40] other: XD
[01/07/2012 16:06:44] me: x'D
[01/07/2012 16:06:51] me: google translate is awesome
[01/07/2012 16:06:55] other: One sec - beth is here :D
[01/07/2012 16:10:02] other: Sorry ^-^;
[01/07/2012 16:10:07] other: She's bored and so wandering.
[01/07/2012 16:10:11] me: haha
[01/07/2012 16:10:25] me: she should get another Spainard to chat with
[01/07/2012 16:10:26] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:10:27] other: I wanted to thank you again for your earlier words about Carlos, it was nice to hear you talk about me sometimes and very nice to hear you think he loves me too ^-^; (And you of course, but I already knew it about you.) He's important to me and it really is very comforting that you think I am important to him too - it's nice to have people care about me right now :)
[01/07/2012 16:10:43] other: Hahaha, yes she should, she has an Indian but that isn't nearly as awesome as a Spainard ;)
[01/07/2012 16:11:05] me: :)
[01/07/2012 16:11:16] me: I was scared about telling you...
[01/07/2012 16:11:24] other: Hah, why? :D
[01/07/2012 16:11:28] me: thought you could not like me talking with Carlos about you
[01/07/2012 16:11:43] other: So long as the things you both say are not hurtful things then I love that you talk about me :)
[01/07/2012 16:11:49] other: It means you both think about me :)
[01/07/2012 16:12:00] other: There is nothing not to like about that :D
[01/07/2012 16:12:08] me: ^_^ the first thing i think off in the morning and the last in the night
[01/07/2012 16:12:24] me: from almost a year...
[01/07/2012 16:12:37] other: Heh, I think of you often throughout the day although unfortunately I think about work first and last thing because I am obsessive ;)
[01/07/2012 16:12:43] other: But I still think of you very often during the day.
[01/07/2012 16:12:52] me: I know hahaha workaholic!
[01/07/2012 16:12:54] other: Heh, I have for a long time too though I don't know how long.
[01/07/2012 16:12:58] other: Hah, I know.
[01/07/2012 16:13:04] other: Hopefully one day it is worth it being a workaholic.
[01/07/2012 16:13:07] other: :D
[01/07/2012 16:13:13] me: it sure will
[01/07/2012 16:13:25] me: you already are a rockstar
[01/07/2012 16:13:32] me: it can only go higher
[01/07/2012 16:13:41] other: I hope so. It is very weird right now.
[01/07/2012 16:13:51] other: Since Carlos left I have less direction, though I am trying.
[01/07/2012 16:14:13] me: well
[01/07/2012 16:14:17] me: you have a passion then
[01/07/2012 16:14:28] me: now you have a work... as common mortals do
[01/07/2012 16:14:35] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 16:14:40] other: I do not do as well with just work :D
[01/07/2012 16:14:50] other: Passion makes it possible to help people and not get too tired.
[01/07/2012 16:14:56] other: Without the passion it is very tiring.
[01/07/2012 16:14:58] me: i know
[01/07/2012 16:15:08] me: that's why I admire your work so much...
[01/07/2012 16:15:22] other: I appreciate that, thank you :)
[01/07/2012 16:15:45] me: hopefully we will light the bomb with Todd's interview
[01/07/2012 16:16:04] other: Hah, indeed :)
[01/07/2012 16:16:09] other: That will be a good one to read his answers too.
[01/07/2012 16:16:32] me: but you surprised me when you showed the Gideros tuts too
[01/07/2012 16:16:49] me: don't you think Gideros is more corona-alike?
[01/07/2012 16:16:58] other: Yeah, I wrote them a fairly long time ago - like the week Carlos left.
[01/07/2012 16:17:08] other: Uhm, from memory yes.
[01/07/2012 16:17:22] me: so why Moai instead of Gideros?
[01/07/2012 16:17:23] other: But I don't know about the company so much - I am not sure about them.
[01/07/2012 16:17:27] other: Well
[01/07/2012 16:17:28] me: ok
[01/07/2012 16:17:32] other: 1) Moai has the money and users to offer me a job.
[01/07/2012 16:17:51] other: 2) Jayant is Gideros fanboy and they welcome him despite his craziness
[01/07/2012 16:18:01] me: shit
[01/07/2012 16:18:17] other: 3) Todd is a good guy and he strikes me as yeah, being OK.
[01/07/2012 16:18:18] other: Shit? ^-^;
[01/07/2012 16:18:27] me: J shit
[01/07/2012 16:18:36] other: Yeah
[01/07/2012 16:18:42] other: That's OK though.
[01/07/2012 16:18:46] other: It just shows they are not so smart.
[01/07/2012 16:18:53] other: They welcome in such negativity - it is no good.
[01/07/2012 16:18:57] me: you know what?
[01/07/2012 16:19:00] other: Hmmm?
[01/07/2012 16:19:11] me: I asked Carlos what sdk recommends for me
[01/07/2012 16:19:14] me: try to guess
[01/07/2012 16:19:15] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:19:20] other: Uhm
[01/07/2012 16:19:24] other: Moai would be #1 I think.
[01/07/2012 16:19:33] me: fail
[01/07/2012 16:19:35] me: keep trying
[01/07/2012 16:19:36] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:19:40] other: Unity?
[01/07/2012 16:19:48] me: yeah :)
[01/07/2012 16:19:56] other: Did he suggest Moai also?
[01/07/2012 16:19:59] other: Or just Unity?
[01/07/2012 16:20:04] me: for me, unity
[01/07/2012 16:20:11] me: it was a personal question
[01/07/2012 16:20:23] other: Are you planning to do 3D stuff, or still 2D?
[01/07/2012 16:20:27] me: both
[01/07/2012 16:20:58] me: but he told me that cos he knows my time is very limited (when actually working, wich I'm not doing this past weeks) and I need something very stable
[01/07/2012 16:21:19] other: That is a good point, yes. Definitely.
[01/07/2012 16:21:34] other: I have an interest in Unity but will not look at it for a long time yet I don't think as I have no 3D experience at all.
[01/07/2012 16:21:34] me: of course I don't mind what he says if you go to Moai
[01/07/2012 16:21:36] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:21:40] other: Hahahaha
[01/07/2012 16:21:53] other: We'll see :)
[01/07/2012 16:21:58] me: yeah
[01/07/2012 16:22:00] other: Can always use more than one thing.
[01/07/2012 16:22:18] me: I'm looking at both but won't start anything new until I see your steps
[01/07/2012 16:22:37] me: and had a bad experience with Unity previously
[01/07/2012 16:23:04] other: Really?
[01/07/2012 16:23:09] me: Tobor's developer
[01/07/2012 16:23:24] me: he tried to fill ChocoRun reviews with one star rating with his friends
[01/07/2012 16:23:45] me: cos his game was shitty and his players were pointing others to Choco
[01/07/2012 16:24:15] me: the Tornado Twins helped me to shut him up
[01/07/2012 16:24:27] other: Sorry, one sec, mother and beth are here
[01/07/2012 16:24:30] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:27:55] other: Back ^-^;
[01/07/2012 16:28:06] other: That's really sucky.
[01/07/2012 16:28:10] me: yeah...
[01/07/2012 16:28:27] me: I think we had every possible pain in the ass with Choco
[01/07/2012 16:28:29] me: cloned
[01/07/2012 16:28:31] me: attacked
[01/07/2012 16:28:35] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:28:40] other: XD I remember the cloning.
[01/07/2012 16:28:46] other: I called that guy in the UK lol
[01/07/2012 16:28:53] me: yeah xD
[01/07/2012 16:29:00] other: What an ass.
[01/07/2012 16:29:08] me: you did an awesome work there
[01/07/2012 16:29:17] me: thanks again for that
[01/07/2012 16:29:20] other: Heh I tried,
[01/07/2012 16:29:22] other: No worries :)
[01/07/2012 16:29:40] other: I should be sending me report but am soooo lazy tonight.
[01/07/2012 16:29:57] me: it's long to do?
[01/07/2012 16:30:28] other: Eh I have to do more forum stuff first.
[01/07/2012 16:30:29] other: Then send it.
[01/07/2012 16:30:42] me: oh ok
[01/07/2012 16:30:43] other: It isn't too long itself but it means finishing up forum stuff.
[01/07/2012 16:30:48] me: but it's late...
[01/07/2012 16:30:52] me: you should go rest
[01/07/2012 16:30:56] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 16:31:05] other: I can't do that - I took a half day yesterday :D
[01/07/2012 16:31:08] other: No one else works weekends.
[01/07/2012 16:31:11] other: Just me.
[01/07/2012 16:31:18] me: and the pizza guy
[01/07/2012 16:31:18] other: They will notice if I am gone ;)

[01/07/2012 16:31:38] other: But others do not, only me now.
[01/07/2012 16:31:39] other: Carlos used to do some stuff on weekends I think, sometimes.
[01/07/2012 16:31:42] me: oh
[01/07/2012 16:31:50] other: And the pizza guy who unfortunately doesn't work for c-labs or I'd get free pizzas ;)
[01/07/2012 16:31:57] me: so if I want to hack the site and put a huge photo of Carlos I should do it on a weekend?
[01/07/2012 16:32:09] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 16:32:12] me: :D
[01/07/2012 16:32:30] other: If you post anything "bad" you can get away with it longest if on a Friday night.
[01/07/2012 16:32:36] other: Then W normally only knows if someone tells him.
[01/07/2012 16:32:43] other: And that someone always has to be me.
[01/07/2012 16:32:50] other: Often I just don't tell him anything any more ;)
[01/07/2012 16:32:50] me: hahahaha
[01/07/2012 16:33:14] me: I don't know how to hack a site... but I know someone who does very well
[01/07/2012 16:33:23] me: I may ask for his services eventually
[01/07/2012 16:33:26] me: :)
[01/07/2012 16:33:42] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 16:33:56] other: Totally :D
[01/07/2012 16:34:11] me: and maybe post a photo of w in a horrid naked woman body
[01/07/2012 16:34:12] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:34:19] other: Hahahahahaha :D
[01/07/2012 16:34:43] other: I'm sure we'd all laugh at that.
[01/07/2012 16:34:59] me: we'll try then ;)
[01/07/2012 16:35:25] me: this guy I tell you gives security classes at HP
[01/07/2012 16:35:33] other: That's very cool!

[01/07/2012 16:35:53] other: Yeah, him.
[01/07/2012 16:35:55] other: That's great :)
[01/07/2012 16:36:10] me: he's totally crazy and could seem a jerk on first look
[01/07/2012 16:36:32] me: permanent angry face until he realizes you are not so stupid
[01/07/2012 16:36:32] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:36:45] me: not a good one to deal with noobs
[01/07/2012 16:36:46] other: Hahahaha :D
[01/07/2012 16:36:56] other: Doesn't sound like it, no.

[01/07/2012 16:44:48] me: it is...
[01/07/2012 16:44:59] *** other envi how-get-2nd-values.html ***
[01/07/2012 16:45:16] other: Because he posted follow ups to it ;)
[01/07/2012 16:45:34] me: ok, let me read it
[01/07/2012 16:45:41] other: Thank you :)
[01/07/2012 16:46:12] me: hmmm
[01/07/2012 16:46:27] me: I don't know how string.find works, let me check that too
[01/07/2012 16:48:56] other: He is right that it doesn't seem to print right (worry)
[01/07/2012 16:49:10] me: true
[01/07/2012 16:49:15] me: it seems a bug
[01/07/2012 16:49:21] other: Hrm, interesting.
[01/07/2012 16:49:26] other: How did you try printing?
[01/07/2012 16:49:41] me: didn't try anything, just read
[01/07/2012 16:49:47] other: t = string.find("Hello Lua user", "Lua")
print (call)
[01/07/2012 16:49:49] other: That wont work
[01/07/2012 16:49:51] other: BUT
[01/07/2012 16:49:54] me: BUT
[01/07/2012 16:49:58] other: print( string.find("Hello Lua user", "Lua") )
[01/07/2012 16:50:01] other: That does work.
[01/07/2012 16:50:03] other: (worry)
[01/07/2012 16:50:25] me: in some languages a string is treaten like a table of chars
[01/07/2012 16:50:38] me: in this case it seems like that
[01/07/2012 16:50:58] other: Ah
[01/07/2012 16:51:06] other: t, x = string.find("Hello Lua user", "Lua")
print (t, x)
[01/07/2012 16:51:06] other: That works.
[01/07/2012 16:51:11] me: :)
[01/07/2012 16:51:18] other: :D
[01/07/2012 16:51:24] other: I am surprised I figured that being so sleepy lol
[01/07/2012 16:51:37] me: well I'm not....

[01/07/2012 16:51:43] other: Hah, thank you :D
[01/07/2012 16:52:12] other: What letters would you use for it?
[01/07/2012 16:52:17] other: He is using v
[01/07/2012 16:52:25] other: But I don't know what to use - is there a proper letter?
[01/07/2012 16:52:43] other: (I used t and x in my example but that was random)
[01/07/2012 16:52:54] me: when a result is a table I usually use t, but Carlos hates my naming conventions
[01/07/2012 16:52:55] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:53:01] other: Hahahaha really? :D
[01/07/2012 16:53:05] me: yeah
[01/07/2012 16:53:07] other: I will use v and t.
[01/07/2012 16:53:13] other: What does he use for a table?
[01/07/2012 16:53:20] me: he mocks a lot about that because it's the Microsoft style xD
[01/07/2012 16:53:29] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 16:54:15] me: also using _ on parameters, like _parameter1
[01/07/2012 16:54:27] me: don't ever show him anything made like that
[01/07/2012 16:54:27] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:54:38] other: Hahaha
[01/07/2012 16:54:54] other: He doesn't like that I guess?
[01/07/2012 16:54:57] other: Is that also Microsoft style?
[01/07/2012 16:55:02] me: totally
[01/07/2012 16:55:17] me: it's the way I learned to code... with C# and Visual Studio
[01/07/2012 16:55:29] other: The cat was playing and scratched me a little hard before by the way XD
[01/07/2012 16:55:36] other: I just saw a tiny bit of blood :D
[01/07/2012 16:55:40] me: :(

[01/07/2012 16:56:11] other: Heh, thank you ^-^; It will be OK.
[01/07/2012 16:56:17] other: That is something else Carlos doesn't like - cats :D
[01/07/2012 16:56:24] me: really???
[01/07/2012 16:56:25] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:56:30] other: Yes haha
[01/07/2012 16:56:36] other: He is not a fan of cats at all.
[01/07/2012 16:56:38] me: at the end it will be true that we are a lot alike
[01/07/2012 16:56:43] me: except from the coding style
[01/07/2012 16:56:45] me: xD
[01/07/2012 16:56:48] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 16:56:53] other: I like cats OK myself, I like dogs too.
[01/07/2012 16:56:59] other: It depends on the individual animal :)

[01/07/2012 16:58:02] other: Haha true

[01/07/2012 16:59:41] me: maybe because I had some that were incredibly good
[01/07/2012 16:59:52] other: I have had really awesome cats and dogs.
[01/07/2012 16:59:58] other: I had a cat who thought he was a dog.

[01/07/2012 17:01:38] me: but yeah, even if I'm allergic I can't help but touching any cat that comes close
[01/07/2012 17:01:40] other: Hah, do you know what a Magpie is?

[01/07/2012 17:02:32] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:02:37] other: Then he would go in and out.
[01/07/2012 17:02:45] other: He came back at night to sleep and in the day he came and went as he pleased.
[01/07/2012 17:02:50] me: I'd better take care to not get one leg up when going to pee
[01/07/2012 17:02:52] other: VERY strange for a bird.
[01/07/2012 17:02:55] other: Hahahahaha :D

[01/07/2012 17:08:04] other: By the way, don't mention to Carlos that I know you guys talk about me, OK? I'd be shy ^-^;
[01/07/2012 17:08:07] other: Hahahahaha
[01/07/2012 17:08:10] me: it was a good point to put choco in teh middle of the ball
[01/07/2012 17:08:10] other: Even the front page has issues.
[01/07/2012 17:08:27] other: That is true ;)
[01/07/2012 17:08:32] me: ^_^
[01/07/2012 17:08:42] me: ok, I'll tell him later when he gets online
[01/07/2012 17:08:57] other: Haha I said "don't".
[01/07/2012 17:08:59] other: :D
[01/07/2012 17:09:00] me: :D
[01/07/2012 17:09:06] me: I know, just kidding
[01/07/2012 17:09:11] other: Just making sure :P
[01/07/2012 17:09:17] me: but you dont have to be shy
[01/07/2012 17:09:28] me: we are not jealous of each other
[01/07/2012 17:09:29] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:09:37] me: we can share a peach without troubles
[01/07/2012 17:09:40] other: Hahaha
[01/07/2012 17:09:50] other: I would be shy because sometimes I am with him.
[01/07/2012 17:09:55] other: And I think he knows I love him a lot
[01/07/2012 17:10:02] me: he does
[01/07/2012 17:10:09] me: BUT
[01/07/2012 17:10:09] other: but if he knew I was all like "Yay Carlos and Alex were talking/thinking about me" I would be shy.
[01/07/2012 17:10:15] other: Do you think so? I hope so.
[01/07/2012 17:10:19] me: in what way you love him?
[01/07/2012 17:10:22] me: (worry)
[01/07/2012 17:10:41] other: Why? What way does he think I love him? XD
[01/07/2012 17:10:46] other: I love him in a complicated way :D
[01/07/2012 17:10:52] me: ....
[01/07/2012 17:11:02] me: maybe I'll become jealous of him after all
[01/07/2012 17:11:09] other: Hah, you do not need to be jealous.
[01/07/2012 17:11:16] other: I also love you in a complicated way, but differently to Carlos.
[01/07/2012 17:11:23] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:11:29] me: this is not complicated
[01/07/2012 17:11:44] other: My love is always complicated - but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[01/07/2012 17:11:54] me: it's as easy as getting a plane and saying fuck you all without looking back
[01/07/2012 17:11:59] other: But, in what way does he think I love him?
[01/07/2012 17:12:00] me: at least is as easy as that for me
[01/07/2012 17:12:02] other: Hahahaha :D
[01/07/2012 17:12:10] other: For me it is not that easy quite yet - I think it will be soon :)
[01/07/2012 17:12:19] me: :)
[01/07/2012 17:12:20] other: Remember I have not been single that long yet ;)
[01/07/2012 17:12:25] other: Still a little adjusting to do.
[01/07/2012 17:12:31] me: i don't want you to get used to it
[01/07/2012 17:12:34] me: you could like it
[01/07/2012 17:12:36] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:12:52] other: But you said you think he knows I love him, why do you think so? I hope he knows. I find it harder to express things to him than to you.
[01/07/2012 17:12:53] other: Hah
[01/07/2012 17:12:56] other: I don't think so.
[01/07/2012 17:12:57] me: the way you love him was about me not Carlos
[01/07/2012 17:13:07] other: I am not the kind to like being single for long.
[01/07/2012 17:13:16] other: I am happier in a good relationship :)
[01/07/2012 17:13:19] me: I know he loves you as if you were his daughter
[01/07/2012 17:13:30] other: I hope so, I love him like my family also.
[01/07/2012 17:13:34] other: I really do.
[01/07/2012 17:13:39] me: :)
[01/07/2012 17:13:43] other: :)
[01/07/2012 17:13:50] me: you don't have to hope or think
[01/07/2012 17:13:53] me: it's like that
[01/07/2012 17:14:02] other: Do you think so?
[01/07/2012 17:14:05] me: YES
[01/07/2012 17:14:16] me: and I don't think it
[01/07/2012 17:14:18] me: I know it
[01/07/2012 17:14:29] other: Did he ever say that or are you guessing? ^-^;
[01/07/2012 17:14:34] other: Maybe I just annoy him like a child :D
[01/07/2012 17:14:39] me: hahahaha
[01/07/2012 17:14:57] me: Peach I know it... but for the same reason I said before I made a promise not to tell
[01/07/2012 17:15:04] me: he made me promise that
[01/07/2012 17:15:15] other: Ah I see, that is OK. I understand.
[01/07/2012 17:15:28] other: I don't know why he would make you promise but I respect that :)
[01/07/2012 17:15:54] other: Thanks for telling me as much as you have anyway, it is truly a great comfort.
[01/07/2012 17:16:12] me: you don't know how hard this is...
[01/07/2012 17:16:16] me: I really want to tell you
[01/07/2012 17:16:28] other: I kind of want you to :D
[01/07/2012 17:16:32] other: But I cannot ask that.
[01/07/2012 17:16:40] other: Whatever you tell me stays between us, so if you want to you can.
[01/07/2012 17:16:44] other: And no one else ever knows.
[01/07/2012 17:16:52] other: But also you don't *have* to tell me anything if you do not want to.
[01/07/2012 17:17:05] other: As close as I am to Carlos what we talk about is still yeah, between us.
[01/07/2012 17:17:13] me: ok...
[01/07/2012 17:17:21] other: :*
[01/07/2012 17:17:30] me: Carlos rejected a work offer because he can't get you there with him...
[01/07/2012 17:17:41] other: Wow.
[01/07/2012 17:18:00] me: so now you can be totally sure
[01/07/2012 17:18:15] other: That is - yeah.
[01/07/2012 17:18:20] other: That does make me totally sure.
[01/07/2012 17:18:26] me: PLEASE
[01/07/2012 17:18:26] other: Thank you VERY much for telling me that.
[01/07/2012 17:18:31] other: It means a LOT to me to know.
[01/07/2012 17:18:39] me: don't even insinuate that to him
[01/07/2012 17:18:40] me: PLEASE
[01/07/2012 17:18:42] other: Don't worry.
[01/07/2012 17:18:46] other: Don't worry at ALL.
[01/07/2012 17:18:48] me: :)
[01/07/2012 17:18:52] me: ok...
[01/07/2012 17:18:55] other: Would never, ever even think it while talking to him.
[01/07/2012 17:19:04] other: Never hint, never insinuate, never ever.
[01/07/2012 17:19:15] me: thanks
[01/07/2012 17:19:17] other: Maybe I'd think about it if I'm honest because can't control thoughts ;) But you know what I mean.
[01/07/2012 17:19:26] other: Nothing you ever tell me goes beyond our chats :)
[01/07/2012 17:19:32] me: I trust you
[01/07/2012 17:19:34] other: Unless it's like, you know, general stuff :P
[01/07/2012 17:19:36] other: Like code.
[01/07/2012 17:19:40] me: and I thought you should know that
[01/07/2012 17:19:42] other: Haha :D
[01/07/2012 17:19:48] other: I really, REALLY appreciate knowing that.
[01/07/2012 17:19:55] other: I'm very glad you told me.
[01/07/2012 17:20:01] other: It is a really good thing to know.
[01/07/2012 17:20:22] me: that doesn't mean I tell anyone what we discuss...
[01/07/2012 17:20:26] me: I'm not like that
[01/07/2012 17:20:42] other: Hah, no I know.
[01/07/2012 17:20:47] other: I know you don't do that.
[01/07/2012 17:20:55] other: You keep secrets well - but some secrets are better shared.
[01/07/2012 17:20:57] other: And this was one of those.
[01/07/2012 17:21:09] other: Carlos would only have asked you not to tell me because he thought I would feel upset and guilty.
[01/07/2012 17:21:19] other: He worries about my feelings because he knows what I am like.
[01/07/2012 17:21:20] me: yeah...
[01/07/2012 17:21:26] other: But I do not feel that.
[01/07/2012 17:21:39] other: I feel moved and happy that he cares so much.
[01/07/2012 17:21:44] other: I will never repeat what you told me to anyone
[01/07/2012 17:21:50] other: BUT my point is that you know, it was a good thing.
[01/07/2012 17:21:55] me: :)
[01/07/2012 17:21:56] other: I am very happy to know it :)
[01/07/2012 17:21:57] me: it was
[01/07/2012 17:22:03] other: Thank you very much for sharing that with me, honestly.
[01/07/2012 17:22:05] me: anything that makes you happy is
[01/07/2012 17:22:17] other: Heh :*
[01/07/2012 17:22:24] me: :*!!!
[01/07/2012 17:22:46] me: I feel now you will try to date Carlos xD
[01/07/2012 17:22:50] me: shit
[01/07/2012 17:22:50] other: other yawwwwwwns lazily
[01/07/2012 17:22:51] other: Haha
[01/07/2012 17:23:09] other: I will be honest with you - I find Carlos attractive, yes.
[01/07/2012 17:23:20] other: But we will never date for many reasons.
[01/07/2012 17:23:21] other: :D
[01/07/2012 17:23:28] other: And nothing wrong with finding someone attractive.
[01/07/2012 17:23:33] other: I find you attractive too.
[01/07/2012 17:23:41] other: And I am sure you find more women than just me attractive too :P
[01/07/2012 17:23:54] other: That you would never even want to date, perhaps.
[01/07/2012 17:23:59] me: not anymore...
[01/07/2012 17:24:14] other: Heh
[01/07/2012 17:24:29] other: Well remember I just came out of a long relationship.
[01/07/2012 17:24:31] other: So I am still adjusting.
[01/07/2012 17:24:37] me: I know
[01/07/2012 17:24:42] other: I can tell you that when I am in a committed relationship I only have eyes for my partner.
[01/07/2012 17:24:43] other: :)
[01/07/2012 17:25:02] me: and that scares me a lot cos at any moment you could meet someone while I am so far away
[01/07/2012 17:25:11] other: You don't have to worry about that, I assure you.
[01/07/2012 17:25:29] other: Right now it doesn't matter who I met I'm not, today, ready to start dating again.
[01/07/2012 17:25:37] other: And already, clearly, I really care about you and I love you.
[01/07/2012 17:25:52] me: thank you...
[01/07/2012 17:26:02] me: I love you like crazy...
[01/07/2012 17:26:07] other: So don't worry - when I am over all this and settled then you are there :)
[01/07/2012 17:26:15] other: I wont have a chance to go meet anyone haha :D
[01/07/2012 17:26:16] me: and I will do my best to make you happy
[01/07/2012 17:26:19] other: You see what I mean?
[01/07/2012 17:26:25] other: I know, you always do that for me and I love you too :)
[01/07/2012 17:26:34] me: :)
[01/07/2012 17:26:52] me: I think I need to go out to the balcony and scream...
[01/07/2012 17:27:02] other: I do need more time to be fully over this but yes, I hope that makes sense, that when I am I know you are there and I already care for you - I wont be meeting anyone else or want to :D
[01/07/2012 17:27:08] other: That may be a bad idea :D
[01/07/2012 17:27:12] other: You would seem crazy.
[01/07/2012 17:27:19] me: who cares
[01/07/2012 17:27:23] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:27:26] me: in fact, I am
[01/07/2012 17:27:29] other: ^-^; Your neighbors I am guessing ;)
[01/07/2012 17:27:31] other: Hahahaha
[01/07/2012 17:27:37] other: :D Scream if you wish, I wont object.
[01/07/2012 17:27:45] me: already did it
[01/07/2012 17:27:50] other: Haha good for you :D
[01/07/2012 17:27:51] me: a granny came out
[01/07/2012 17:27:52] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:27:55] other: LOL!
[01/07/2012 17:28:01] other: Poor old lady
[01/07/2012 17:28:05] other: I'm sure she thought you were insane
[01/07/2012 17:28:09] me: hahahaha
[01/07/2012 17:28:19] me: she is looking me trough the window
[01/07/2012 17:28:26] other: I might go have another cig - bit bad I know but it's to keep me awake :D
[01/07/2012 17:28:27] other: LOL!
[01/07/2012 17:28:34] other: That's funny :D
[01/07/2012 17:28:41] me: ok I'll wait for the police here
[01/07/2012 17:28:43] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:28:46] other: Hahahaha
[01/07/2012 17:28:58] other: OK, no more screaming for now ;) BRB
[01/07/2012 17:29:04] me: :*
[01/07/2012 17:34:25] other: Back :)
[01/07/2012 17:34:31] me: ^_^
[01/07/2012 17:34:36] other: I will go to sleep soon I think, I turned on my electric blanket :)
[01/07/2012 17:34:42] other: Just have to finish forum stuff.
[01/07/2012 17:34:46] me: I have to tell you something else
[01/07/2012 17:34:51] other: Yes? ^-^;
[01/07/2012 17:34:58] me: something else Carlos and I disagree on
[01/07/2012 17:34:59] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:35:07] other: Haha, what do you disagree on? :D
[01/07/2012 17:35:14] me: you don't need any makeup!!!
[01/07/2012 17:35:31] me: you are beautiful as you are
[01/07/2012 17:35:34] other: Hah! Did he tell you he thought I needed makeup? Or did I tell you that? (I can't remember ^-^;)
[01/07/2012 17:35:40] other: I know he thinks I need it.
[01/07/2012 17:35:42] me: you did xD
[01/07/2012 17:35:56] other: Hah I wasn't sure - am a bit slow tonight as you know ;)
[01/07/2012 17:35:58] me: but that's not true
[01/07/2012 17:36:09] other: He thinks I should wear makeup and that I should wear much girlier clothes.
[01/07/2012 17:36:21] me: either with or without it, you are precious
[01/07/2012 17:36:26] other: Heh, thank you :)
[01/07/2012 17:36:33] me: and I love your Che shirt
[01/07/2012 17:36:36] me: :D
[01/07/2012 17:36:47] other: To be honest most days I do not want to wear it - so much work and it seems so fake much of the time.
[01/07/2012 17:36:53] other: Beth and Briar ALWAYS wear a lot.
[01/07/2012 17:37:03] other: If you see them without it they look *odd* because you get so used to it.
[01/07/2012 17:37:07] other: I don't want to be like that.
[01/07/2012 17:37:15] other: Sometimes makeup is OK but not all the damn time :D
[01/07/2012 17:37:20] other: Hah, good, I like that shirt also :)
[01/07/2012 17:37:22] me: totally agree
[01/07/2012 17:37:44] me: one of the things that make me love you so much is because you are natural
[01/07/2012 17:37:46] other: I used to have a nice Che tshirt but it got lost at some point. >.<' It was black and had a red outline of him.
[01/07/2012 17:37:52] other: Heh, thank you :) That is very sweet.
[01/07/2012 17:38:00] other: I like being just "me".
[01/07/2012 17:38:16] me: it's too much being just you
[01/07/2012 17:38:19] me: ;)
[01/07/2012 17:38:26] other: I don't like dressing up so often with the crazy make up and stuff. To be honest I also kind of hate dresses and skirts most of the time :D
[01/07/2012 17:38:32] other: I want to get back into wearing them *sometimes*
[01/07/2012 17:38:35] other: But not often.
[01/07/2012 17:38:45] other: I prefer wearing all black, honestly.
[01/07/2012 17:39:06] me: I'm forced to wear nice clothes and be all shaved up at work
[01/07/2012 17:39:15] other: Black boots, black pants, black belt, black long sleeved T shirt and a black button up shirt open over the top - comfortable but looks OK too.
[01/07/2012 17:39:15] me: but when I'm not there... well you saw the photo
[01/07/2012 17:39:16] me: xD
[01/07/2012 17:39:25] other: Sometimes I wear red bowling shows to make it more interesting.
[01/07/2012 17:39:28] other: Or a white belt.
[01/07/2012 17:39:29] other: :D
[01/07/2012 17:39:32] me: :D
[01/07/2012 17:39:32] other: Hah yes :)
[01/07/2012 17:39:38] me: I like your style
[01/07/2012 17:39:44] other: I'm glad :)
[01/07/2012 17:39:54] other: I feel much more comfortable in pants, honestly.
[01/07/2012 17:39:59] me: me too
[01/07/2012 17:40:03] me: skirts don't fit me well
[01/07/2012 17:40:05] other: It's like, how the fuck do you cross your legs in a skirt?
[01/07/2012 17:40:07] other: Haha :D
[01/07/2012 17:40:21] other: Right now I have one leg tucked under me on my chair
[01/07/2012 17:40:26] other: in a skirt I couldn't do that.
[01/07/2012 17:40:31] other: Not without flashing *everyone* XD
[01/07/2012 17:40:34] me: well you could
[01/07/2012 17:40:34] me: xD

[01/07/2012 17:41:41] other: Thank you too :)
[01/07/2012 17:41:51] other: And as I said please don't mention to Carlos that I know you guys talk about me as I'd be shy ;)
[01/07/2012 17:41:56] me: I won't
[01/07/2012 17:42:02] other: And as I also said don't worry, will never breathe a word of anything you said to me, of course :)

[02/07/2012 6:19:01] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:19:23] other: Haha
[02/07/2012 6:19:36] other: I thought you were too hot to sleep or something, maybe ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:19:49] me: thats very true ususally
[02/07/2012 6:19:52] me: usually
[02/07/2012 6:19:53] me: xD

[02/07/2012 6:29:18] me: hehe I won!
[02/07/2012 6:29:21] other: I haven't brushed my hair today and it looks just fine :D One plus of it being shorter.
[02/07/2012 6:29:25] other: Hah, yes you did ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:29:36] me: hahaha
[02/07/2012 6:29:41] other: How is the weather there this morning?
[02/07/2012 6:29:48] me: I like it so much now... (your hair)
[02/07/2012 6:29:57] me: it's... grey
[02/07/2012 6:30:06] me: but that's ok
[02/07/2012 6:30:10] me: fresh and nice
[02/07/2012 6:30:21] other: Heh, I'm glad, I will probably wash it tonight so it will be straighter still I hope :)
[02/07/2012 6:30:32] other: Does that mean it's cooler this morning there?
[02/07/2012 6:30:33] me: how did you sleep?
[02/07/2012 6:30:41] me: no way
[02/07/2012 6:30:51] me: nothing is cold talking with you
[02/07/2012 6:31:02] other: I slept well overall although my mother woke me up at 8:30 by mistake when she was getting ready.
[02/07/2012 6:31:13] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:31:16] other: Then I woke up again a bit later and was having an anxiety attack for some reason >.<'
[02/07/2012 6:31:28] other: I get them randomly sometimes, not too badly but it never feels great first thing in the morning.
[02/07/2012 6:31:28] me: oh
[02/07/2012 6:31:37] other: It's not a big deal or anything, just a bit irritating ;)
[02/07/2012 6:31:39] me: do you feel better now?
[02/07/2012 6:31:44] other: I do, thank you :)
[02/07/2012 6:31:54] other: I wasn't anxious about anything, it just randomly happens sometimes.
[02/07/2012 6:32:00] me: I don't really understand how that works...
[02/07/2012 6:32:08] me: i know some people have them
[02/07/2012 6:32:19] other: What part don't you understand? Will try to explain :)
[02/07/2012 6:32:38] me: how do you feel when you have that kind of attack
[02/07/2012 6:32:46] me: or what is needed to be nice again
[02/07/2012 6:33:00] other: Once you relax for a little you go back to normal.
[02/07/2012 6:33:13] other: What I feel is fast breathing, fast heart, a little panic and sometimes a little nausea.
[02/07/2012 6:33:26] me: :(
[02/07/2012 6:33:31] other: And weakness too sometimes.
[02/07/2012 6:33:40] other: It's OK, I don't get really bad ones.
[02/07/2012 6:33:45] me: ok ok
[02/07/2012 6:33:49] other: Normally I can hide the fact I'm having one :D
[02/07/2012 6:34:04] other: I have had them around people before with no one having any idea - so they are not so bad :)
[02/07/2012 6:34:30] me: nice but if you have one with me around tell me...
[02/07/2012 6:34:38] other: I would tell you, I promise :)
[02/07/2012 6:34:47] me: just in case i start talking about something that can get you more nervous
[02/07/2012 6:34:52] other: Haha
[02/07/2012 6:34:56] other: Don't worry - that wouldn't happen anyway.
[02/07/2012 6:35:05] other: I do not get nervous easily.
[02/07/2012 6:35:16] other: And it doesn't seem to effect panic/anxiety attacks for me.
[02/07/2012 6:35:22] other: For me they are just random things :)
[02/07/2012 6:35:46] me: I hope a kiss doesn't have any side effect ;)
[02/07/2012 6:35:58] other: Haha no, kisses do not do that to me :*
[02/07/2012 6:36:05] me: :*!
[02/07/2012 6:36:11] other: So, what do you have to do at work today?
[02/07/2012 6:36:14] other: Or do you not know yet?
[02/07/2012 6:36:19] me: hehehe
[02/07/2012 6:36:22] me: HAHAHAHAHAHA

[02/07/2012 6:36:30] other: Hah? ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:36:34] me: laughing like a mad villain
[02/07/2012 6:36:41] other: Lol - I noticed. Why? :D
[02/07/2012 6:37:00] me: today I'll tell my boss what he did
[02/07/2012 6:37:02] me: well
[02/07/2012 6:37:06] me: we have a meeting
[02/07/2012 6:37:25] me: 5 people (directives) and the new one (me) to kill him
[02/07/2012 6:37:39] me: in a good way
[02/07/2012 6:37:42] other: I see ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:37:44] other: Sounds like fun, lol.
[02/07/2012 6:37:47] me: but he messed it all up so bad...
[02/07/2012 6:37:59] other: Yes he broke some ordering thing or something, right?
[02/07/2012 6:38:08] me: and he's the kind of 'everyone should think im so good'
[02/07/2012 6:38:40] me: he broke how prices are retrieved from the database
[02/07/2012 6:39:13] me: adding new fields required that aren't take on account by hundreds of additional softwares that look on our database
[02/07/2012 6:39:17] me: so almost nothing worked
[02/07/2012 6:39:29] other: Wow that sounds terrible.
[02/07/2012 6:39:39] me: it was
[02/07/2012 6:39:40] other: Did that get fixed now? I can't remember if you told me or not.
[02/07/2012 6:39:44] other: I know you said it was a big job.
[02/07/2012 6:39:55] me: xD oh! you don't listen to me!

[02/07/2012 6:40:16] me: hahahaha
[02/07/2012 6:40:17] other: I remember you said it would take at least a day, right?
[02/07/2012 6:40:25] me: I got it fixed on saturday
[02/07/2012 6:40:28] me: at 1 am
[02/07/2012 6:40:28] other: I can't remember if you told me it got done or not yet though.

[02/07/2012 6:40:35] other: Well done ^-^;

[02/07/2012 6:41:07] me: after a party and being so tired as you were yesterday, I can overlook that
[02/07/2012 6:41:08] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:41:28] other: Yes I was going to say I was very out of it yesterday, I don't always remember so much when am that tired and worn out.
[02/07/2012 6:41:29] other: :)
[02/07/2012 6:41:39] me: no worries
[02/07/2012 6:41:49] other: I should be working but am still waking up ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:42:04] me: that way I can tell you things twice and spend more time with you
[02/07/2012 6:42:05] me: :D
[02/07/2012 6:42:16] other: Hahahaha :D

[02/07/2012 6:42:37] me: did you ended your work yesterday?
[02/07/2012 6:42:48] me: well the window is half open
[02/07/2012 6:42:54] other: I didn't get quite as much done as I wanted to but I did *just* finish the forum stuff up.
[02/07/2012 6:43:02] other: I have lots of emails and more forum stuff to do today.
[02/07/2012 6:43:05] me: i have one arm freezing and the other warm
[02/07/2012 6:43:06] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:43:10] other: Hahahahaha
[02/07/2012 6:43:21] other: XD
[02/07/2012 6:43:35] me: cool, just getting the work done is what you should do ;)
[02/07/2012 6:43:53] other: I will finish it one day :D
[02/07/2012 6:44:00] other: I am still behind because of the last month a bit.
[02/07/2012 6:44:12] me: went to check it out: 26
[02/07/2012 6:44:23] other: Because I was away and then got a bit behind while in California, then back, then split, then move, etc. so still not *quite* up to date yet.
[02/07/2012 6:44:30] other: Oh that is a good temperature :)
[02/07/2012 6:44:38] me: yes
[02/07/2012 6:44:51] other: I don't know what it is here *looks*
[02/07/2012 6:44:56] me: but I can see the sun showing his nose behind some mountains
[02/07/2012 6:45:12] me: soon it will be way hotter
[02/07/2012 6:45:24] other: About 10 here right now I think but feels way colder.
[02/07/2012 6:45:33] other: Yeah I don't like it too hot or too cold ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:46:00] me: you know...
[02/07/2012 6:46:02] other: I almost want to go take a nap :D
[02/07/2012 6:46:03] other: Hmmm?
[02/07/2012 6:46:25] me: if I do what you do... travelling, moving... etc... I'll probably be fired
[02/07/2012 6:46:25] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:46:34] other: Haha
[02/07/2012 6:46:41] other: Well I work while I do those things ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:46:50] other: I just have too much work for any one person to keep up on ;)
[02/07/2012 6:47:04] me: I know... oh those noobs
[02/07/2012 6:47:12] me: I remember when I was younger
[02/07/2012 6:47:15] other: I try to reply to every email which is really hard :D
[02/07/2012 6:47:16] me: and asked a lot too
[02/07/2012 6:47:17] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:47:18] other: Hah
[02/07/2012 6:47:23] other: Nothing wrong with that :)
[02/07/2012 6:47:34] other: I just get so many people I want to help and it's hard to do it all in one day.
[02/07/2012 6:48:12] other: It would be easier if I didn't want to reply to every email - but I do.
[02/07/2012 6:48:13] me: it's incredible you do as much as you 'just' do
[02/07/2012 6:48:19] other: I don't want anyone to not get replies XD
[02/07/2012 6:48:22] other: Haha
[02/07/2012 6:48:35] other: Maybe ^-^; I don't know. I don't think of it like that.
[02/07/2012 6:48:39] other: I think of how much I *don't* do ^-^;
[02/07/2012 6:48:50] me: hahaha
[02/07/2012 6:48:58] me: always look at the bright side of life
[02/07/2012 6:49:07] other: Hah I try, most of the time ;)
[02/07/2012 6:49:12] other: It's hard when you are drowning in emails.
[02/07/2012 6:49:20] other: I hate it if people have to wait too long for replies.
[02/07/2012 6:49:21] me: yay! our answer was useful

[02/07/2012 6:50:03] other: Yes he can.
[02/07/2012 6:50:07] other: Good stuff :)
[02/07/2012 6:50:53] other: Resisting urge to nap.

[02/07/2012 6:51:36] other: I'm getting much better though.

[02/07/2012 6:53:39] me: :P
[02/07/2012 6:53:40] other: And let me know how your meeting goes, OK?
[02/07/2012 6:53:42] other: Haha

[02/07/2012 6:56:30] me: xD
[02/07/2012 6:56:32] other: I don't but only because too many people try grabbing my phone and I don't want to have to explain who you are to everyone (yet) ;)
[02/07/2012 6:56:34] other: Hah
[02/07/2012 6:56:36] other: That is sweet :)

[03/07/2012 7:01:10] me: :D
[03/07/2012 7:01:29] other: But no - he looks like he is trying to look "hard".
[03/07/2012 7:01:51] me: oh don't worry, if sometime you get to meet them... they'll all know you think they all are jerks
[03/07/2012 7:02:32] other: Hahahaha :D

[03/07/2012 7:12:16] me: ^_^
[03/07/2012 7:12:20] me: thanks
[03/07/2012 7:12:22] other: It is special because it is from you and was thoughtful and "Peach".
[03/07/2012 7:12:31] me: hahaha
[03/07/2012 7:12:38] other: She got it because it was a Nintendo thing and she didn't know what to get me one year for bday/xmas or something.
[03/07/2012 7:12:39] other: :)
[03/07/2012 7:12:48] me: hahahaha

[03/07/2012 7:16:03] me: some days super hot and now very freshy
[03/07/2012 7:16:14] me: that's uncommon here
[03/07/2012 7:16:18] other: I like warm or cool but not hot or cold.
[03/07/2012 7:16:30] other: I am so fussy about the temperature/weather :D
[03/07/2012 7:16:34] me: oh you can't say this is cold

[03/07/2012 7:17:57] me: that's why it feels colder
[03/07/2012 7:18:03] other: Ah windy, I hate windy, makes me hair go crazy.
[03/07/2012 7:18:08] other: Oh you should RT Carlos tweet too, about Tablet Wars by the way.

[03/07/2012 7:18:15] other: Am sure he'd appreciate that :)
[03/07/2012 7:18:27] me: I like when wind moves girls hair :D
[03/07/2012 7:18:30] other: I need to think about tying my hair back sometime but I have never been good at that.

[03/07/2012 7:19:11] other: Hahahahaha :D
[03/07/2012 7:19:16] other: It's just crazy I think, but we will see.
[03/07/2012 7:19:27] other: You can decide what you think when you see it in person.
[03/07/2012 7:19:35] me: then I can take you to a covered place and put your hair at its place
[03/07/2012 7:19:42] me: ^_^
[03/07/2012 7:19:57] other: Hah well that will be easier now it isn't as long and crazy :D
[03/07/2012 7:20:02] other: Though as I said it grows very fast.
[03/07/2012 7:20:25] me: no worries
[03/07/2012 7:20:32] me: I'd like it either long or short
[03/07/2012 7:20:41] me: about shaved I can't say the same...
[03/07/2012 7:20:42] me: (worry)
[03/07/2012 7:20:44] other: Hahahaha
[03/07/2012 7:20:51] other: I actually looked OK with a shaved head.
[03/07/2012 7:21:02] other: A little eyeliner and stubble on my head and it was actually not bad.
[03/07/2012 7:21:10] other: But I don't plan to shave it again any time soon :)
[03/07/2012 7:21:19] me: of course you'd look good
[03/07/2012 7:21:25] me: you can't look bad
[03/07/2012 7:21:26] me: xD
[03/07/2012 7:21:40] me: but I like playing with a long hair...
[03/07/2012 7:22:18] me: so why it was so important to RT Carlos?
[03/07/2012 7:22:23] me: something I should know?
[03/07/2012 7:22:50] other: Sorry, spilled something.
[03/07/2012 7:23:00] other: He just asked me to RT it earlier.
[03/07/2012 7:23:08] other: I think just to get traffic to his site probably :)
[03/07/2012 7:23:18] me: So who wins this war after all?

Actually developers and cross platform framework makers like Appcelerator or Moai win.
[03/07/2012 7:23:23] me: hahahaha
[03/07/2012 7:23:34] me: someone forgot about a little sdk that's around
[03/07/2012 7:24:10] other: Heh
[03/07/2012 7:24:16] other: :D
[03/07/2012 7:24:30] other: Appcelerator I only just started with but is nice so far, I like it :)
[03/07/2012 7:24:43] me: how about api's?
[03/07/2012 7:24:59] me: it can do well things like accelerometer?
[03/07/2012 7:25:13] other: I don't know enough about it yet to comment on that - too early. Give me a week or so and I will be able to ;)
[03/07/2012 7:25:31] other: I have only been playing with most basic of basic stuff so far.
[03/07/2012 7:25:34] me: take as much time as you need
[03/07/2012 7:25:55] me: when you make your decision I'll probably follow like a trusty noble knight
[03/07/2012 7:26:04] other: Haha, very good :)
[03/07/2012 7:26:19] other: I wanted to ask you something on a serious note - what drug was it you had a problem with before?
[03/07/2012 7:26:30] other: I know you are better now but just so I know, I thought I'd ask.
[03/07/2012 7:26:38] me: well
[03/07/2012 7:26:54] me: it was a kind of weed that's treaten
[03/07/2012 7:27:17] other: Ah, so like very strong weed? Or is it mixed with something?
[03/07/2012 7:27:21] me: not cocaine or anything like that
[03/07/2012 7:27:39] me: it's kinda grown with lsd in its roots
[03/07/2012 7:28:27] other: Ah I see.
[03/07/2012 7:28:35] other: I haven't had anything like that, not combined.
[03/07/2012 7:28:38] other: I just wondered.
[03/07/2012 7:28:39] me: I thought it was just weed when I tried it
[03/07/2012 7:28:46] me: and become addicted
[03/07/2012 7:28:54] me: i feel like shit for that
[03/07/2012 7:29:21] me: so much lost time in my life
[03/07/2012 7:29:34] other: You got over it though, which was great :)
[03/07/2012 7:29:37] other: You took control of the problem.
[03/07/2012 7:29:40] me: and how hard it was to leave it...
[03/07/2012 7:29:54] me: i know, and in a way, I'm proud of myself
[03/07/2012 7:30:03] me: but it surprised me
[03/07/2012 7:30:14] me: how addicted I was when trying to leave
[03/07/2012 7:30:14] other: It would have been very hard I imagine, very hard indeed.
[03/07/2012 7:30:35] me: those scenes you usually see at movies...
[03/07/2012 7:30:41] me: cold sweat and all nervous
[03/07/2012 7:30:45] other: Yeah, I know the scenes you mean.
[03/07/2012 7:30:51] me: I had some panick attacks like that
[03/07/2012 7:31:05] other: Ah yeah, that would be hard.
[03/07/2012 7:31:06] me: panic without k
[03/07/2012 7:31:11] me: right?
[03/07/2012 7:31:16] other: Yes, sorry, without k.
[03/07/2012 7:31:20] other: "panic".
[03/07/2012 7:31:23] me: haha no worries
[03/07/2012 7:31:27] other: :D
[03/07/2012 7:31:32] other: You spotted it before me ^-^;

[03/07/2012 7:31:48] me: haven't even got close to it anymore
[03/07/2012 7:32:03] other: That is good, much better to not be dependant.
[03/07/2012 7:32:13] me: oh no
[03/07/2012 7:32:19] me: I'm addicted to a new drug

[04/07/2012 6:19:30] other: What time is it there?
[04/07/2012 6:19:33] other: This seems early.
[04/07/2012 6:19:35] me: 6:19
[04/07/2012 6:19:41] other: Ugh, so early.
[04/07/2012 6:19:44] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:19:49] other: Soooooo early!
[04/07/2012 6:19:53] other: I couldn't stand being up then.
[04/07/2012 6:19:58] other: Not unless I hadn't been to bed yet.
[04/07/2012 6:20:08] me: it's ok!
[04/07/2012 6:20:16] me: i usually wake up at 7
[04/07/2012 6:20:21] other: You really should sleep in more - get some rest.
[04/07/2012 6:20:33] other: You need eough sleep to work and get ahead of that idiot who was your boss.
[04/07/2012 6:20:48] me: I'm already way ahead of him :D
[04/07/2012 6:20:55] me: yesterday I gave him code lessons
[04/07/2012 6:21:05] other: Hahahahaha :D
[04/07/2012 6:21:19] other: Very amusing.
[04/07/2012 6:21:23] other: I am sure that was a good day :)
[04/07/2012 6:21:29] me: coding things in chinese is fun
[04/07/2012 6:21:33] me: yes it was
[04/07/2012 6:21:57] me: he didn't know we can store th chinese strings on the database and extract them at need
[04/07/2012 6:22:13] me: so at first he told our mates in china it wasn't possible
[04/07/2012 6:22:18] other: Wow
[04/07/2012 6:22:23] me: one hour later they received a report from me
[04/07/2012 6:22:27] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:22:37] other: Hah, nice :D
[04/07/2012 6:23:00] me: so what about yours? did you get to rest a little more?
[04/07/2012 6:23:14] other: I did not, not yet.
[04/07/2012 6:23:17] other: Well
[04/07/2012 6:23:19] other: I half did
[04/07/2012 6:23:23] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:23:28] other: I spoke to Carlos a little while I was working briefly.
[04/07/2012 6:23:40] other: So that was kind of like relaxing - at least more relaxing than just working ;)
[04/07/2012 6:23:53] me: I was thinking you were about to say... I didn't moved my legs while working...
[04/07/2012 6:23:57] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:24:03] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 6:24:14] other: Well that's true too - they rest while I work :P
[04/07/2012 6:24:19] other: But I do move them a bit.
[04/07/2012 6:24:31] me: hehe
[04/07/2012 6:24:33] other: And when I go for my cigs I actually do a little cardio exercise now too ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:24:40] me: i had an argumentwith Carlos yesterday
[04/07/2012 6:24:44] other: Smoking + exercise may not be super healthy but it's a start.
[04/07/2012 6:24:47] other: Hah, did you? What about?
[04/07/2012 6:24:49] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 6:24:59] me: not a bad one, it was really fun
[04/07/2012 6:25:22] me: I'll tell you in some time :P
[04/07/2012 6:25:27] other: Well, it's good to know it wasn't a bad one ^-^; I didn't think it would be too bad, neither of you seem the type for bad arguments.
[04/07/2012 6:25:31] other: Lol, but I'm curious now :D
[04/07/2012 6:25:40] me: :*
[04/07/2012 6:25:55] me: don't ask him either please
[04/07/2012 6:26:04] other: Hah I wouldn't ask him.
[04/07/2012 6:26:09] other: But I still want to know ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:26:14] me: soon
[04/07/2012 6:26:17] me: bt not today
[04/07/2012 6:26:19] me: but
[04/07/2012 6:26:26] other: Why not?
[04/07/2012 6:26:32] other: That is OK but am curious as to why not :P
[04/07/2012 6:26:43] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 6:26:55] other: As you can see am all around a very curious girl :D
[04/07/2012 6:27:01] me: I like that
[04/07/2012 6:27:07] me: :D
[04/07/2012 6:27:18] me: but you'll be intrigued for a time
[04/07/2012 6:27:28] other: Hah I will be curious and want to know :P
[04/07/2012 6:27:38] other: Are you putting off telling me just to mock me? XD
[04/07/2012 6:27:50] me: I'll never do that
[04/07/2012 6:27:55] me: (and tell you i'm doing it)
[04/07/2012 6:27:57] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:28:00] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 6:28:09] other: So - why must I wait for you to tell me, then? ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:28:28] me: don't ask!
[04/07/2012 6:28:29] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:28:35] other: XD
[04/07/2012 6:29:06] me: you'll like it
[04/07/2012 6:29:10] other: I could guess but I think I'd probably be wrong. I don't know the kind of things you would "argue" about, even as fun ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:29:12] me: it's all I'm going to say
[04/07/2012 6:29:21] other: Hah, alright, well then just tell me when you will tell me about it :P
[04/07/2012 6:29:28] other: So at least I know how long I shall be curious for.
[04/07/2012 6:29:33] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 6:29:50] me: 1 year, 2 months a week and half a day from now
[04/07/2012 6:30:05] other: Hahahahaha, I am not waiting that long! :P
[04/07/2012 6:30:20] me: do you have any other option?
[04/07/2012 6:30:33] other: By then you will have forgotten anyway, no one remembers a funny argument that long.
[04/07/2012 6:30:41] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 6:30:43] me: I do
[04/07/2012 6:30:43] other: I am certain I could simply make you tell me :P
[04/07/2012 6:30:47] other: But I will not do that.
[04/07/2012 6:30:51] me: hmmm
[04/07/2012 6:30:56] me: and how would you do that?
[04/07/2012 6:31:01] me: now i'm curious
[04/07/2012 6:31:02] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:31:10] other: I wouldn't do it - because it would be unfair.
[04/07/2012 6:31:19] other: But I have multiple ways I could do it :D
[04/07/2012 6:31:25] other: But, none would be fair.
[04/07/2012 6:31:28] other: And some would be mean.
[04/07/2012 6:31:36] other: And I would not do things that are unfair or mean.
[04/07/2012 6:31:43] other: I am responsible with my power (devil)
[04/07/2012 6:31:50] me: HAHAHA
[04/07/2012 6:31:53] other: ;)
[04/07/2012 6:31:55] me: but you are thinking bad
[04/07/2012 6:31:58] me: :P
[04/07/2012 6:32:12] me: your power is getting its own will
[04/07/2012 6:32:15] other: Hah I can think if I do not act - everyone thinks evil things sometimes :P
[04/07/2012 6:32:16] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 6:32:16] me: control it!
[04/07/2012 6:32:26] other: It is controlled (angel)
[04/07/2012 6:32:38] me: yeah sure... haha :*
[04/07/2012 6:32:45] other: But nonetheless, a year is a very long time - why so long? XD
[04/07/2012 6:32:58] me: cos I like the way you ask me
[04/07/2012 6:33:01] me: ^_^
[04/07/2012 6:33:23] other: Lol so you like how I ask you so you make me wait a year? :D
[04/07/2012 6:33:31] me: hahaha indeed
[04/07/2012 6:33:45] other: There is no reason to make me wait so long XD
[04/07/2012 6:33:55] me: no it's not
[04/07/2012 6:33:59] me: :)
[04/07/2012 6:34:05] me: it was about you of course
[04/07/2012 6:34:18] other: I didn't think it would be about me ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:34:24] other: That makes me more curious :D
[04/07/2012 6:34:39] other: If it was about me I probably have a right to know ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:34:46] me: I should go for a cofee now...
[04/07/2012 6:34:51] me: :P
[04/07/2012 6:34:59] other: I want a cig anyway. When I come back you'll tell me :P
[04/07/2012 6:35:06] other: You don't want me being distracted from work by it all day.
[04/07/2012 6:35:12] me: only if you make me tell you
[04/07/2012 6:35:18] me: :*
[04/07/2012 6:35:23] other: BRB :*
[04/07/2012 6:40:48] other: Back :)
[04/07/2012 6:40:52] me: ^_^
[04/07/2012 6:41:00] me: so how's the weather today?
[04/07/2012 6:41:16] other: Chilly :P I wore my scarf outside.
[04/07/2012 6:41:19] other: Now - are you going to tell me so I don't wonder all day?
[04/07/2012 6:41:30] me: I don't know I0m having fun
[04/07/2012 6:41:35] me: haha
[04/07/2012 6:41:41] other: (Changing the subject doesn't work when I am curious - I am relentless!)
[04/07/2012 6:41:44] other: :D
[04/07/2012 6:42:01] me: what would you do to make me tell you? I'm really curious about that :D
[04/07/2012 6:42:17] other: Oh so now you want me to tell you something? :P
[04/07/2012 6:42:28] other: I will tell you in 1 year, 2 months, 1 week and half a day :D
[04/07/2012 6:42:46] me: touche
[04/07/2012 6:42:50] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 6:43:06] other: I wouldn't - but I believe there are things I could do. "Nice" things and "mean" things.
[04/07/2012 6:43:07] me: we argued about you...
[04/07/2012 6:43:12] other: But both would be manipulative - so unfair.
[04/07/2012 6:43:12] me: needing or not...
[04/07/2012 6:43:17] other: And I would do neither.
[04/07/2012 6:43:22] other: Needing or not?
[04/07/2012 6:43:27] me: to wear...
[04/07/2012 6:43:31] me: makeup!
[04/07/2012 6:43:32] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:43:34] other: Hahaha :D
[04/07/2012 6:43:43] other: What did he say and what did you say?
[04/07/2012 6:43:47] other: I know he thinks I need it.
[04/07/2012 6:43:50] me: hahaha
[04/07/2012 6:44:06] me: the ceo thinks you need it to progress in the bussiness
[04/07/2012 6:44:42] me: and ultimately she stated that he knows what a girl needs because two of his ex make fashion covers
[04/07/2012 6:44:49] me: then it all turned crazy
[04/07/2012 6:44:51] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:44:59] other: Hahaha
[04/07/2012 6:45:01] other: What did you say?
[04/07/2012 6:45:11] me: so you are a sex symbol or what?
[04/07/2012 6:45:12] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:45:15] other: He does think all women need makeup I think. He is foo-foo.
[04/07/2012 6:45:17] other: Lol :D
[04/07/2012 6:45:32] me: c: no! the car is! i'm just a nerd who watches porn all day
[04/07/2012 6:45:34] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:45:41] other: Hahahahaha :D
[04/07/2012 6:45:53] other: That is funny.
[04/07/2012 6:46:07] other: So how did the argument end?
[04/07/2012 6:46:15] me: no conclusion
[04/07/2012 6:46:23] me: but you don't need makeup
[04/07/2012 6:46:27] me: :)
[04/07/2012 6:46:30] other: I don't mind that he thinks I need to wear makeup ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:46:37] other: So long as he doesn't think am ugly without it :D
[04/07/2012 6:46:42] other: But I don't think he thinks that anyway.
[04/07/2012 6:46:53] other: I think he just thinks I look better/more professional wearing it.
[04/07/2012 6:47:01] me: yeah that was his point
[04/07/2012 6:47:12] me: but that's just well... artificial
[04/07/2012 6:47:15] other: I know.
[04/07/2012 6:47:24] other: I don't really like makeup most of the time.
[04/07/2012 6:47:28] other: But I know it makes me look older :D
[04/07/2012 6:47:34] me: and everybody thinks you are professional in your pijamas
[04/07/2012 6:47:41] other: Hahahaha, that is true :D
[04/07/2012 6:48:04] me: i just hope you don't come to end as.. let me look at it
[04/07/2012 6:48:22] other: Sorry can you reword that? I didn't understand it.
[04/07/2012 6:48:26] me: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home
[04/07/2012 6:48:31] other: Oh hahaha :D
[04/07/2012 6:48:37] other: I understand what you were saying now.
[04/07/2012 6:48:39] other: I took a moment.
[04/07/2012 6:48:41] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:48:43] other: I have read that comic many times :D
[04/07/2012 6:48:59] other: I didn't even click the link then because I know what it is by heart :D
[04/07/2012 6:49:04] me: the 'one year in' scares me
[04/07/2012 6:49:07] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:49:08] other: It is one of my favorite Oatmeal ones.
[04/07/2012 6:49:21] other: Hah
[04/07/2012 6:49:29] other: I have been working at home for more than a year ;)
[04/07/2012 6:49:32] other: And am fine.
[04/07/2012 6:49:47] me: yeah, you can still talk properly ^_^
[04/07/2012 6:49:49] other: And I always wear pants - just PJ pants most of the time :D
[04/07/2012 6:50:02] other: Though since I moved here have been wearing "real" pants each day.
[04/07/2012 6:50:06] other: I am wearing jeans today.
[04/07/2012 6:50:06] me: : )...
[04/07/2012 6:50:21] other: How did that conversation come up with Carlos anyway? :D
[04/07/2012 6:50:29] other: It seems like a strange thing to come up in conversation.
[04/07/2012 6:50:36] other: "Oh by the way Peach should/shouldn't wear makeup!"
[04/07/2012 6:50:36] other: :D
[04/07/2012 6:50:38] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 6:50:40] me: that's something i really can't tell you
[04/07/2012 6:50:56] other: Because you don't remember or because you are being difficult? :P
[04/07/2012 6:50:57] me: seriously, not now
[04/07/2012 6:51:10] other: Awww - but it's about me, I want to know :D
[04/07/2012 6:51:22] me: no no, I have to shut up
[04/07/2012 6:51:25] me: really
[04/07/2012 6:51:31] other: Why? ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:51:32] me: we'll talk about it soon
[04/07/2012 6:51:37] me: oh shut up!
[04/07/2012 6:51:39] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:51:40] other: XD
[04/07/2012 6:51:48] other: Why can't you tell me? :D
[04/07/2012 6:51:55] other: It's about me, you'd want to know if it were about you :P
[04/07/2012 6:52:06] other: If I talked to Carlos about you wearing makeup I'm sure you'd be very keen to know about it :D
[04/07/2012 6:52:18] me: yeah well... I'm not going to tell you
[04/07/2012 6:52:24] other: Why not? XD
[04/07/2012 6:52:29] me: whatever you do, unfair, mean or even nasty xD
[04/07/2012 6:52:40] other: I wouldn't do any of those things ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:52:51] other: But I would like to know, since it does involve me ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:52:54] me: I'd probably like you to...
[04/07/2012 6:52:59] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:53:02] me: but no!
[04/07/2012 6:53:05] me: shhhht
[04/07/2012 6:53:08] other: You probably would but it wouldn't be right - it would be manipulation.
[04/07/2012 6:53:13] other: XD
[04/07/2012 6:53:20] other: But nonetheless, tell me (angel)
[04/07/2012 6:53:27] other: You brought it up I am guessing.
[04/07/2012 6:53:33] me: NOoooOOOoooOOOooOOooOOOOo
[04/07/2012 6:53:47] other: No you didn't bring it up, or no you are trying not to tell me? :P
[04/07/2012 6:53:52] me: neither
[04/07/2012 6:53:56] me: :P
[04/07/2012 6:54:00] other: XD Tellllll meeeeeeeeeee!

[04/07/2012 6:54:39] me: have a twnkie and relax little monster
[04/07/2012 6:54:44] other: But I like hearing about all discussions with you and people I know. I like that we have mutual friends.
[04/07/2012 6:54:55] other: It's like I said the other day I think it makes us closer, because we have people we both know.
[04/07/2012 6:54:56] other: I like that.
[04/07/2012 6:54:58] other: BUT
[04/07/2012 6:55:04] other: I am also madly curious because it's about me

[04/07/2012 6:55:41] other: I saw but you were online so I haven't read it yet.
[04/07/2012 6:55:47] other: Because I was skyping with you ^-^;
[04/07/2012 6:55:54] other: BUT, tell me :P
[04/07/2012 6:56:04] other: How did it come up? I want to know now :D
[04/07/2012 6:56:14] me: please... manipulate me as much as you want, use me, but I won't tell you
[04/07/2012 6:56:15] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:56:34] other: I am not doing anything manipulative, although you obviously want me to :D
[04/07/2012 6:56:45] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 6:56:51] other: I believe you will tell me on your own just because you know I want to know, it's about me, and there is no reason not to tell me :P
[04/07/2012 6:57:14] me: there's a reason and you shouldn't really ask more
[04/07/2012 6:57:26] me: cos I'm weak when it comes to hide things at you
[04/07/2012 6:57:40] me: and I don't want to spoil it yet
[04/07/2012 6:57:46] me: ok?
[04/07/2012 6:57:49] other: Maybe that is just a sign that you shouldn't hide things from me. :P
[04/07/2012 6:57:52] other: Alright, well
[04/07/2012 6:57:56] other: When will you tell me?
[04/07/2012 6:58:00] me: U_U
[04/07/2012 6:58:02] other: Maybe I could drop it for now :P
[04/07/2012 6:58:16] me: yeah, please...
[04/07/2012 6:58:17] me: xD
[04/07/2012 6:58:25] other: If you tell me when you'll tell me :P
[04/07/2012 6:58:32] other: I don't want it to be in a year :D
[04/07/2012 6:58:39] me: ok, sooner than a year
[04/07/2012 6:58:52] other: And you have a real reason for not telling me for awhile, yes?
[04/07/2012 6:58:57] other: And you aren't just messing with me :P
[04/07/2012 6:59:04] me: no I'm not messing
[04/07/2012 6:59:19] other: Very well, I trust you and if you have a real reason then I wont bug you about it for now.
[04/07/2012 6:59:27] me: me breaths...
[04/07/2012 6:59:35] other: I just enjoy hearing about your talks with Carlos as it's nice, the whole mutual friend thing.
[04/07/2012 6:59:49] other: And of course I'm interested when people are talking about me too ;) But I do really like the mutual friend stuff.
[04/07/2012 6:59:50] me: I love that a lot too...
[04/07/2012 6:59:53] other: It's really cool that we have that.
[04/07/2012 6:59:56] other: :)
[04/07/2012 7:00:02] me: you made me think a lot
[04/07/2012 7:00:07] me: not only about eople
[04/07/2012 7:00:16] me: but everything we shared this past 2 years
[04/07/2012 7:00:26] other: I will be back in a minute as I have to make toast, feeling a little shaky - sorry, keep typing and I brb
[04/07/2012 7:00:35] me: :*
[04/07/2012 7:00:37] other: (not being rude, just a tad shaky and need food) xx
[04/07/2012 7:00:44] me: go eat!
[04/07/2012 7:02:08] me: you know if I take a look back these years I shared much more with you than anyone else, and that makes me smile cos being at a half the world distance it's incredible we've been able to share so many touching and great things...
[04/07/2012 7:03:29] me: from our first fb messages to the release of chocorun, the issue about techority becoming paid, operation SYJ, your past birthday... so many things...
[04/07/2012 7:03:44] me: overall awesome experiences
[04/07/2012 7:05:26] other: Back :) Got my toast.
[04/07/2012 7:05:36] me: and you don't know it yet but I made a promise to my mother
[04/07/2012 7:05:40] other: I agree, we have had a very special time together since we met :)
[04/07/2012 7:05:41] me: well two promises
[04/07/2012 7:05:47] other: Heh, should I ask what they are?
[04/07/2012 7:05:49] other: Or no?
[04/07/2012 7:05:53] me: yes i can tell you that
[04/07/2012 7:05:55] me: :)
[04/07/2012 7:06:02] other: What are they, then? :)
[04/07/2012 7:06:29] me: when I started working on apps one day I told her... I'm going to share a newspaper cover with Steve Jobs someday
[04/07/2012 7:06:46] me: of course she laughed at me at thought i was so freakin fool
[04/07/2012 7:07:13] me: but then ChocoRun 2.0 appeared on the newspaper the same week Steve passed away, and they were together at the same page
[04/07/2012 7:07:35] other: That is very cool, sad because of his death, but cool that it could happen.
[04/07/2012 7:07:54] me: yeah I'd had preferred another way of having it happening
[04/07/2012 7:07:58] other: Had it not then it might never have happened because obviously he would not be in the paper so much, though I imagine he will still pop up from time to time, as important as he is.
[04/07/2012 7:08:04] other: But it happened and that is still awesome :)
[04/07/2012 7:08:16] me: it is
[04/07/2012 7:08:21] other: And what was your other promise?
[04/07/2012 7:08:24] me: the second statement...
[04/07/2012 7:08:26] me: :D
[04/07/2012 7:08:39] me: when we started sending us messages on fb...
[04/07/2012 7:08:50] me: I'm going to meet this girl!!!
[04/07/2012 7:08:54] other: Haha :D
[04/07/2012 7:09:13] me: oh shut up you idiot she's from australia, what in the hell have you lost there?

[04/07/2012 7:09:58] me: this past week i told her we will meet soon
[04/07/2012 7:10:08] other: What did she say? :)
[04/07/2012 7:10:15] me: she thinks you are imaginary
[04/07/2012 7:10:16] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:10:19] other: LOL :D
[04/07/2012 7:10:37] other: I would record her a video but I doubt she speaks English?
[04/07/2012 7:10:49] me: she just speaks a little little tiny bit
[04/07/2012 7:10:57] other: Yes, so that may not work that well, haha :D
[04/07/2012 7:11:00] me: tried to learn one year ago
[04/07/2012 7:11:18] me: she can say she lives in a house, hello, bye and not much more
[04/07/2012 7:11:19] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:11:26] other: Haha
[04/07/2012 7:11:36] other: I am like that with Spanish, I understand very little.
[04/07/2012 7:11:47] me: well i tried to teach her... useless
[04/07/2012 7:11:51] other: Maybe one day soon I will learn more and record myself saying "I am not imaginary!" in Spanish :D
[04/07/2012 7:12:00] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:12:24] me: if someday she sees you it better be when having a seat
[04/07/2012 7:12:36] other: How far away from you does she live now?
[04/07/2012 7:12:50] me: by car... almost 2 hours
[04/07/2012 7:13:04] other: That isn't too bad.
[04/07/2012 7:13:06] me: nope
[04/07/2012 7:13:16] other: Maybe if I visit you there later in the year then I can go meet her :)
[04/07/2012 7:13:17] me: i go visit her almost every weekend
[04/07/2012 7:13:21] other: And tell her I am real :D
[04/07/2012 7:13:26] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:13:35] other: You would have to play translator :D
[04/07/2012 7:13:42] me: you want to meet my parents so soon?
[04/07/2012 7:13:43] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:13:46] other: Hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:13:55] other: Well then she wont think you are crazy at least :P
[04/07/2012 7:14:00] other: Parents always either love me or hate me.
[04/07/2012 7:14:03] other: No middle ground.
[04/07/2012 7:14:07] me: hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:14:14] me: I know she'll love you
[04/07/2012 7:14:18] other: The ones who hate me it is always because they worry their son will do anything for me and they don't like that :D
[04/07/2012 7:14:29] other: The ones who love me see me as a good person and know their son is OK.
[04/07/2012 7:14:31] me: I can't say the same about my father but I don't care what he thinks
[04/07/2012 7:14:42] me: and I'm using care knowing what it means
[04/07/2012 7:14:46] other: That's OK, I don't care what my father thinks either :P
[04/07/2012 7:15:02] other: I wont mind if your father doesn't like me :)
[04/07/2012 7:15:13] other: I will politely tell him to go screw himself in English :D
[04/07/2012 7:15:22] other: .... or I'll try to be polite.
[04/07/2012 7:15:25] other: (angel)
[04/07/2012 7:15:26] me: they don't live together
[04/07/2012 7:15:30] other: Oh I see.
[04/07/2012 7:15:39] other: I remember they had problems long ago when we were talking.
[04/07/2012 7:15:45] me: and I really don't want you to meet him
[04/07/2012 7:15:52] other: I think one of your parents lost their job back then?
[04/07/2012 7:16:02] me: oh no
[04/07/2012 7:16:07] me: it's been from very long
[04/07/2012 7:16:11] other: That is OK, I don't have to meet him.
[04/07/2012 7:16:12] me: almost 8 years
[04/07/2012 7:16:14] other: Oh I see.
[04/07/2012 7:16:19] other: I must have been confused.
[04/07/2012 7:16:26] me: my mum lost her job and recovered it
[04/07/2012 7:16:27] other: I remember you telling me about the situation though.
[04/07/2012 7:16:32] other: I guess I thought it was more recent.
[04/07/2012 7:16:35] me: it was weird
[04/07/2012 7:16:44] other: It's good she got it back :)
[04/07/2012 7:16:55] me: she totally lost it a week ago...
[04/07/2012 7:16:59] me: but intentionally
[04/07/2012 7:17:07] other: Hah
[04/07/2012 7:17:10] other: Well that sounds good I think?
[04/07/2012 7:17:24] me: well I'm a little worried but I think she'll do ok
[04/07/2012 7:17:39] me: her company was going bankrupt
[04/07/2012 7:17:52] me: so she left while she could with the money they should pay her
[04/07/2012 7:17:57] other: I see, I hope she does OK, at least she lost it on purpose.
[04/07/2012 7:18:08] other: And didn't stay and get stuck later with less money etc.
[04/07/2012 7:18:16] me: yeah, she's happy with it so...
[04/07/2012 7:18:27] me: oh shit...
[04/07/2012 7:18:32] other: Hmmm?
[04/07/2012 7:18:32] me: I've just realised
[04/07/2012 7:18:40] me: are we talking about my mother?
[04/07/2012 7:18:46] me: this is not right
[04/07/2012 7:18:46] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:18:49] other: Lol
[04/07/2012 7:18:51] other: Why not?
[04/07/2012 7:18:53] other: :D
[04/07/2012 7:19:14] me: now you'll think i'm a little boy always needing mum
[04/07/2012 7:19:15] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:19:18] other: Hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:19:21] other: Not at all.
[04/07/2012 7:19:27] other: It is OK to talk about family, friends, etc ^-^;
[04/07/2012 7:19:34] other: Just dont be like W and talk about mommy all the time.
[04/07/2012 7:19:39] other: And have her pack your lunch for you :D
[04/07/2012 7:19:42] me: hahahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:19:51] other: Did I tell you about his mother packing him lunch?
[04/07/2012 7:19:56] me: no way
[04/07/2012 7:19:56] other: Or maybe Carlos may have mentioned it.
[04/07/2012 7:20:00] me: are you serious?
[04/07/2012 7:20:07] other: She was staying with him when I visited the US.
[04/07/2012 7:20:15] other: She stayed with him like 3 months.
[04/07/2012 7:20:19] other: And one day he comes into work
[04/07/2012 7:20:23] other: And I see he isn't eating lunch
[04/07/2012 7:20:31] other: Then later he is eating an apple out of a ziplock bag.
[04/07/2012 7:20:36] other: And I say to him, teasing him;
[04/07/2012 7:20:46] other: "Hey W, did your mommy pack that apple for you?"
[04/07/2012 7:20:52] me: XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[04/07/2012 7:21:00] other: And he laughs madly, goes all red and says "Yes. It is organic!"
[04/07/2012 7:21:01] other: :D
[04/07/2012 7:21:14] other: I texted Carlos to tell him about it immediately from the office, he thought it was funny too.
[04/07/2012 7:21:27] other: So W's mommy packs his lunch.
[04/07/2012 7:21:42] me: what kind of ceo is he?
[04/07/2012 7:21:44] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:21:57] other: Heh, no polite words for that I am afraid.
[04/07/2012 7:22:01] other: I should be the CEO :D
[04/07/2012 7:22:13] me: then you'd be degrading
[04/07/2012 7:22:17] other: Hahahaha
[04/07/2012 7:22:19] me: you already are more than that
[04/07/2012 7:22:22] other: ^-^;

[04/07/2012 7:22:57] other: By the way, I wont pester you for any details now as I said I wouldn't - but Carlos didn't say anything bad about me with the makeup stuff did he?
[04/07/2012 7:23:01] other: I was changing subject too briefly ;)
[04/07/2012 7:23:08] other: I just wanted to check the above XD
[04/07/2012 7:23:20] other: It popped into my head and I hoped he didn't think anything too bad about me.
[04/07/2012 7:23:34] other: If he did I'd rather know but I hope he didn't think anything too horrible.
[04/07/2012 7:23:37] me: well he better not tell me anything like that if he wants to stay alive
[04/07/2012 7:23:43] me: and he's still alive
[04/07/2012 7:23:43] other: Hahahaha :D
[04/07/2012 7:23:48] other: Very good then.

[04/07/2012 7:24:04] other: The move has set me back a little.
[04/07/2012 7:24:10] me: i will get seriously into it this weekend
[04/07/2012 7:24:21] me: as I told you on my email
[04/07/2012 7:24:27] me: i want to be able to help you with it
[04/07/2012 7:24:28] other: That's good to hear, hopefully we both learn a bit. It's harder than Corona.
[04/07/2012 7:24:35] other: That would certainly be nice if it worked out.
[04/07/2012 7:24:40] other: But no pressure, I know you are very busy too.
[04/07/2012 7:24:49] me: I'm not
[04/07/2012 7:24:53] me: not on weekends

[04/07/2012 7:26:27] other: It will be good although I am still a little shy too :D
[04/07/2012 7:26:34] me: nah
[04/07/2012 7:26:56] me: I've seen your merry christmas video a bizillion times
[04/07/2012 7:27:07] other: Haha, yeah, I was a bit shy even then.
[04/07/2012 7:27:08] other: ^-^;

[04/07/2012 7:27:24] me: you don't have to be shy

[04/07/2012 7:27:32] other: Heh I am a bit shy though, always :D
[04/07/2012 7:27:36] other: But that will pass quickly.
[04/07/2012 7:27:43] me: sure it will :)
[04/07/2012 7:27:49] other: Once we start talking neither of us will be shy any more :)
[04/07/2012 7:27:56] me: when you see i'm even more shy than you
[04/07/2012 7:27:57] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:28:19] other: On a serious note, because I know you have to go soon, I hope you do not mind me asking you about your chats with Carlos - I admit I really like that my two favorite people in the world talk about me and am always intruiged ;)
[04/07/2012 7:28:29] other: Hahaha we will both be shy at first then we will be fine.
[04/07/2012 7:28:41] me: :* of course i don't mind
[04/07/2012 7:28:50] other: Also, don't mention to Carlos I pestered you for info about the makeup stuff please :D
[04/07/2012 7:28:57] other: He will think I'm a child and tease me about it later :D
[04/07/2012 7:29:01] other: I am glad :)
[04/07/2012 7:29:12] other: I really like it, that you talk about me and that I get to hear a bit about it :)
[04/07/2012 7:29:12] me: I'll save that for when it's needed
[04/07/2012 7:29:14] me: xD
[04/07/2012 7:29:18] other: It comes back to the whole mutual friend thing.
[04/07/2012 7:29:21] other: We are far apart
[04/07/2012 7:29:24] other: But we have connections :)
[04/07/2012 7:29:29] other: And he is one of our connections.
[04/07/2012 7:29:33] me: I feel you very close...
[04/07/2012 7:29:48] other: Like "normal" friends, couples, etc - all those people have mutual friends.
[04/07/2012 7:29:48] me: no matter how far we are
[04/07/2012 7:29:58] other: I feel close to you too but I hope you know what I mean.
[04/07/2012 7:30:08] me: sure I do ^_^

[04/07/2012 7:30:12] other: And I like that :)
[04/07/2012 7:30:25] other: (And of course my ego loves knowing my 2 favorite people talk about me ;))

[04/07/2012 7:32:38] me: I've only done the first one
[04/07/2012 7:32:55] other: Let me know what you think when you are done - but no hurry.
[04/07/2012 7:32:58] me: but you make it look simple
[04/07/2012 7:33:04] me: I've read them all
[04/07/2012 7:33:10] other: I am glad to hear that, it's complicated so harder to make look simple than Corona ;)
[04/07/2012 7:33:10] me: just not worked on them
[04/07/2012 7:33:19] other: Cool, thank you, that is good to hear.
[04/07/2012 7:33:27] other: But now you must go before you have to rush yourself.
[04/07/2012 7:33:35] me: at first i was so scared with moai...
[04/07/2012 7:33:41] other: Te amo mucho, besos y abrazos! xx

[05/07/2012 6:23:34] me: well i think i rushed a little too much yesterday
[05/07/2012 6:23:48] other: Is it hot there? If you are dehydrated that will make it worse.
[05/07/2012 6:23:58] me: hehe
[05/07/2012 6:24:05] me: that's why i made you wait
[05/07/2012 6:24:10] me: drink and take a pill
[05/07/2012 6:24:19] other: Hah, good ^-^;

[05/07/2012 6:24:58] me: did you sleep well though?
[05/07/2012 6:25:01] other: How was your evening, too rushed also or OK?
[05/07/2012 6:25:10] other: Not too bad last night overall, not great but OK, thank you :)
[05/07/2012 6:25:19] me: ^_^
[05/07/2012 6:25:41] me: well i cam back from work, ironed some clothes and went directly to bed
[05/07/2012 6:25:45] me: came
[05/07/2012 6:26:08] me: that picture... xD
[05/07/2012 6:26:13] me: 'the other' sent it to me
[05/07/2012 6:26:19] me: he's on holidays now
[05/07/2012 6:26:20] other: Haha :D
[05/07/2012 6:26:35] other: I never iron clothes admittedly. In Sydney I did not even own an iron :D
[05/07/2012 6:26:48] other: "The other" sounds amusing XD
[05/07/2012 6:26:50] me: he says: how is your little cangarroo today?
[05/07/2012 6:27:02] me: cangaroo gosh sorry
[05/07/2012 6:27:06] other: "kangaroo" is how it is spelled just future reference ;)
[05/07/2012 6:27:11] other: You were close.
[05/07/2012 6:27:12] me: oh 'k'
[05/07/2012 6:27:22] me: i'll remember
[05/07/2012 6:27:25] me: :)
[05/07/2012 6:27:31] other: English is not an easy language and "kangaroo" is not an easy word.
[05/07/2012 6:27:34] other: But that is funny :D
[05/07/2012 6:27:44] other: You can tell him that your "little kangaroo" is fine :D
[05/07/2012 6:27:51] me: hahaha nice :*
[05/07/2012 6:28:04] other: My cousin is getting me some pot this week (angel)
[05/07/2012 6:28:08] other: I am pleased about that.
[05/07/2012 6:28:14] me: hmmm
[05/07/2012 6:28:15] other: I think it will improve my sleep a bit.
[05/07/2012 6:28:23] other: (I used to smoke it for that reason.)
[05/07/2012 6:28:30] me: it sure will
[05/07/2012 6:28:30] other: Don't worry, haha, am not a stoner ;)
[05/07/2012 6:28:40] other: I like it but never smoke that much.
[05/07/2012 6:28:51] other: Only at night and only ever one cone.
[05/07/2012 6:28:52] other: :)
[05/07/2012 6:28:55] me: oh it's not bad at all
[05/07/2012 6:29:10] me: if you are stoned you are defenceless
[05/07/2012 6:29:11] me: :D
[05/07/2012 6:29:21] other: I was just explaining because I know some people who smoke a lot of it and smoke it in the morning etc. and wanted to be clear that wasn't me, haha.
[05/07/2012 6:29:23] other: Haha :D
[05/07/2012 6:29:36] other: Well then you will have to remember I only smoke at night so you don't try to abduct me in the day time.
[05/07/2012 6:29:37] other: :D
[05/07/2012 6:30:01] me: hahaha ok! I'll wait and sneak behind you at night
[05/07/2012 6:30:12] other: Just watch out for the cat :P
[05/07/2012 6:30:15] other: He likes to jump at people.
[05/07/2012 6:30:18] other: Especially at night :D
[05/07/2012 6:30:48] me: I can stand a few scratches if i get to kiss your neck from behind ^_^
[05/07/2012 6:30:54] me: :D
[05/07/2012 6:31:01] other: I do like neck kisses ^-^;
[05/07/2012 6:31:14] other: My neck is sensative :D
[05/07/2012 6:31:26] me: oh now that you say that
[05/07/2012 6:31:41] other: Actually I think I spelled that wrong, "sensitive" is how it is spelled I believe. (I am a little sleepy still.)
[05/07/2012 6:31:49] me: your necklace, is it called like that? you wear it from long ago right?
[05/07/2012 6:32:10] other: What I wear, the black thing, is technically called a "choker".
[05/07/2012 6:32:18] me: ok
[05/07/2012 6:32:21] other: I have worn it for, uhm, I'm not sure - but over 10 years.
[05/07/2012 6:32:21] other: :)
[05/07/2012 6:32:25] me: wow!
[05/07/2012 6:32:34] me: better clean it every now and then
[05/07/2012 6:32:36] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:32:38] other: Haha
[05/07/2012 6:32:46] other: I wear it in the shower so it gets cleaned then :D
[05/07/2012 6:32:53] me: hahaha nice
[05/07/2012 6:32:58] other: I never take it off - the only times I have taken it off is when I have worn a collar.
[05/07/2012 6:33:07] me: oops
[05/07/2012 6:33:08] other: And even then I often just leave it on underneath the collar.
[05/07/2012 6:33:12] me: bad take peachy...
[05/07/2012 6:33:20] other: Hmmmm?
[05/07/2012 6:33:27] me: now I'm seeing you at the shower xD
[05/07/2012 6:33:33] other: Hahahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 6:33:46] other: Sorry :P
[05/07/2012 6:33:54] me: it suddenly got hot here...
[05/07/2012 6:33:55] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:33:58] other: Hahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 6:34:11] other: One day you'll probably see me in the shower anyway.
[05/07/2012 6:34:14] other: I'm not that shy :D
[05/07/2012 6:34:39] me: but I'm not so stable to just watch...
[05/07/2012 6:34:40] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:34:54] other: Hah, well I'm sure if I were showering around you that would be fine ^-^;
[05/07/2012 6:35:03] me: :) !!!
[05/07/2012 6:35:21] other: I realized something too, when either of us plan travel, regardless of what happens we must make sure whoever travels does *not* go through Dubai.
[05/07/2012 6:35:30] me: hmm
[05/07/2012 6:35:32] me: why?
[05/07/2012 6:35:44] other: I don't know if flights from there do that but most flights from here do so if I fly I will have to find one that doesn't.
[05/07/2012 6:35:49] other: Dubai is, uhm...
[05/07/2012 6:35:53] other: Well, it's fucked up :D
[05/07/2012 6:35:57] other: For many reasons.
[05/07/2012 6:36:06] me: hahaha
[05/07/2012 6:36:10] other: But as an example if you have a spec of pot residue on you at all - you can go to jail.
[05/07/2012 6:36:19] me: fuck
[05/07/2012 6:36:20] other: They are a very, very fucked up place.
[05/07/2012 6:36:23] other: Yes.
[05/07/2012 6:36:36] other: A guy not long ago had a spec SMALLER than a grain of sugar on the bottom of his shoe.
[05/07/2012 6:36:42] other: It couldn't be seen by the human eye.
[05/07/2012 6:36:51] other: He is in jail now for 4 years.
[05/07/2012 6:37:02] me: if you come here and want some pot we can get it easily, don't have to risk anything
[05/07/2012 6:37:06] other: It's a scary place, Dubai, no one should go there if they can help it.
[05/07/2012 6:37:22] other: I appreciate that but even still, ANY residue puts a person at risk, so neither of us should ever travel there.
[05/07/2012 6:37:27] other: It's not a safe place.
[05/07/2012 6:37:27] me: wow it's scary
[05/07/2012 6:37:35] other: It is a backwards country.
[05/07/2012 6:37:38] other: They have some messed up laws.
[05/07/2012 6:37:49] other: They imprison people they catch having sex outside of marriage, too.
[05/07/2012 6:38:04] me: bdeh
[05/07/2012 6:38:18] other: And if a woman is raped and isn't Muslim and cannot find muslim men to back her up on her story she will also go to jail for "adultery" or whatever.
[05/07/2012 6:38:19] me: i don't think that's ok but not so bad for prison
[05/07/2012 6:38:41] other: You don't think it's OK to have sex outside of marriage? ^-^;
[05/07/2012 6:38:45] me: i knew that, that is a pretty fucked up law
[05/07/2012 6:38:51] me: nope
[05/07/2012 6:39:05] me: if you are married
[05/07/2012 6:39:14] other: Ah, no, see this is a confusion because of English ;)
[05/07/2012 6:39:27] me: oh maybe you mean before marrying someone
[05/07/2012 6:39:28] other: "Sex outside of marriage" doesn't mean cheating on your spouse with someone else you aren't married to.
[05/07/2012 6:39:33] other: Yeah, that is what it means.
[05/07/2012 6:39:36] other: Having sex before marriage.
[05/07/2012 6:39:42] me: well that is VERY OK
[05/07/2012 6:39:43] me: :D
[05/07/2012 6:39:48] other: Haha, I thought so.
[05/07/2012 6:39:51] other: That is why I asked :)
[05/07/2012 6:39:57] other: In Dubai that is illegal.
[05/07/2012 6:40:06] other: Another reason we shouldn't ever go there together :D
[05/07/2012 6:40:09] me: i'm sure it's illegal just for the poor ones
[05/07/2012 6:40:10] other: (angel)
[05/07/2012 6:40:15] other: I am sure too.
[05/07/2012 6:40:23] me: hahaha
[05/07/2012 6:40:30] other: Ignoring that - what will you be up to at work today?
[05/07/2012 6:40:52] me: I think I'll be distracting myself a while
[05/07/2012 6:41:11] me: as the other is on holidays i can get to hide at the server room
[05/07/2012 6:41:21] me: and lock myself so no one can enter
[05/07/2012 6:41:23] me: :D
[05/07/2012 6:41:36] other: Hahahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 6:41:42] other: Sounds like fun ^-^;
[05/07/2012 6:41:51] me: well it's cold and noisy there
[05/07/2012 6:42:01] me: but i kinda need a 'slow' day
[05/07/2012 6:42:02] other: Yeah I imagined it would be kept cool.
[05/07/2012 6:42:10] other: Yeah you sound like yesterday was very tiring.
[05/07/2012 6:42:22] me: some days are like that
[05/07/2012 6:42:33] me: still suffering consequences from my boss messing
[05/07/2012 6:42:48] other: Hmmm, I can imagine that, yes.
[05/07/2012 6:42:51] me: ledger accounts were mostl fucked up
[05/07/2012 6:42:55] me: mostly
[05/07/2012 6:43:05] other: That is a huge pain :(
[05/07/2012 6:43:09] me: and fixing that is very consuming
[05/07/2012 6:43:21] me: every single penny has a consequence
[05/07/2012 6:43:30] other: I would be no good at that I think, fixing that :D
[05/07/2012 6:43:36] other: Yeah, I know it must match up perfectly.
[05/07/2012 6:43:44] me: the financial director was so scared yesterday
[05/07/2012 6:44:15] me: I have to make some reports and the numbers don't match, what are we going to do??!! we'll be all on jail!!!
[05/07/2012 6:44:17] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:44:30] other: Lol :D
[05/07/2012 6:44:48] me: yeah... all red and scared...
[05/07/2012 6:44:51] other: Your old boss would be the one in trouble I would think if anyone got in trouble for it XD
[05/07/2012 6:45:00] other: But that sounds stressful, yes.
[05/07/2012 6:45:07] me: yeah but he doesn't know how to fix it
[05/07/2012 6:45:17] me: and I've been working with that software for 7 years
[05/07/2012 6:45:24] me: so the ball is on my roof
[05/07/2012 6:45:52] other: Say "The ball is in my court" - it is clear what you mean but that is the "traditional" way of saying it ;)
[05/07/2012 6:45:56] me: me yawns so hard his mouth hurts
[05/07/2012 6:46:06] other: Do you know how to fix it?
[05/07/2012 6:46:10] me: ok!
[05/07/2012 6:46:14] other: Heh we are both yawning today :)
[05/07/2012 6:46:22] me: here we say 'la pelota esta en mi tejado'
[05/07/2012 6:46:31] me: wich stands for roof :D
[05/07/2012 6:46:57] me: i know and it's mostly done, just a few delicate touches and it will be all turned on
[05/07/2012 6:47:01] other: Oh quention - how do you say "It's my fault" in Spanish? I read it the other day then forgot it. (I don't need to say it but do not like forgetting.)
[05/07/2012 6:47:12] other: "Tengo mi culpa" I thought, but I think that's wrong.
[05/07/2012 6:47:14] other: Hah, excellent :)
[05/07/2012 6:47:21] me: hmmm
[05/07/2012 6:47:24] me: let's see
[05/07/2012 6:47:38] me: you have to know we don't write in the same order
[05/07/2012 6:48:09] me: It's fault my, would be in the right order in spanish
[05/07/2012 6:48:13] other: I know that ^-^; I don't know the order to write when I am trying to say things sometimes.
[05/07/2012 6:48:18] other: But with this phrase I read it somewhere.
[05/07/2012 6:48:25] other: And I don't remember how it was said.
[05/07/2012 6:48:30] me: so it's translated as: 'es culpa ma'
[05/07/2012 6:48:47] other: "es cupla ma"
[05/07/2012 6:48:49] other: ^-^;
[05/07/2012 6:48:52] other: Cool, thanks.
[05/07/2012 6:48:53] me: culpa
[05/07/2012 6:48:55] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:48:56] other: culpa*
[05/07/2012 6:49:03] other: Damnit I saw that as you said it :D
[05/07/2012 6:49:08] me: cupla sounds like copulate...
[05/07/2012 6:49:13] other: I know the word "culpa" so was just a typo.
[05/07/2012 6:49:13] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:49:14] other: Haha :D
[05/07/2012 6:49:27] other: You are thinking too much about copulating this morning I think :D
[05/07/2012 6:49:35] me: my head hurts
[05/07/2012 6:49:35] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:49:42] me: don't take it too serious
[05/07/2012 6:49:49] other: Probably from thinking too much about copulating :P
[05/07/2012 6:49:53] other: (I am just teasing)
[05/07/2012 6:49:56] me: nahhh
[05/07/2012 6:50:15] me: but I must admit my poor pillow is suffering some hard hugs these nights
[05/07/2012 6:50:21] me: xD
[05/07/2012 6:50:29] other: Awwww
[05/07/2012 6:50:30] me: just hugs!
[05/07/2012 6:50:34] other: I have a shirt I do that to. XD
[05/07/2012 6:50:37] other: Also just hugs :D
[05/07/2012 6:50:38] other: Haha
[05/07/2012 6:50:48] other: I have to go for a few minutes to make a phone call to the electoral commission to make sure they send me a form I need, OK?
[05/07/2012 6:50:55] me: sure
[05/07/2012 6:50:58] me: I'll be here
[05/07/2012 6:51:00] me: :*
[05/07/2012 6:51:01] other: I'll be back in 5-10 :) brb
[05/07/2012 6:51:02] other: xx
[05/07/2012 7:03:17] other: Back
[05/07/2012 7:03:28] me: ^_^
[05/07/2012 7:03:32] other: Sorry, have to get a form sent out to change address with them too - otherwise they will try to fine me later :D
[05/07/2012 7:03:37] me: have they been nice to you?
[05/07/2012 7:03:46] other: They were not too bad :)
[05/07/2012 7:03:55] other: A little slow but you expect that from the government ;)
[05/07/2012 7:04:12] me: hahahaha, from the one here you can expect weeks of waiting
[05/07/2012 7:04:23] other: Here for some places you wait for weeks.
[05/07/2012 7:04:29] me: next wednesday I'll have my passport!
[05/07/2012 7:04:32] me: :D
[05/07/2012 7:04:38] other: Hah, awesome - have you had one before now?
[05/07/2012 7:04:51] me: yeah but it was reaaaaally long ago
[05/07/2012 7:05:05] me: when I was a child we won a theater contest
[05/07/2012 7:05:19] me: and that was a trip to hungary
[05/07/2012 7:05:26] other: That is very cool!
[05/07/2012 7:05:26] me: to act there
[05/07/2012 7:05:37] other: That sounds like it would have been a lot of fun?
[05/07/2012 7:05:46] me: it was incredible
[05/07/2012 7:05:51] me: first time i got drunk
[05/07/2012 7:05:56] other: Haha
[05/07/2012 7:06:01] other: How old were you?
[05/07/2012 7:06:06] me: we went to a hotel with people from every country
[05/07/2012 7:06:18] me: 16
[05/07/2012 7:06:27] me: and never got drunk before
[05/07/2012 7:06:29] me: :P
[05/07/2012 7:06:32] other: Hah, that is funny :D
[05/07/2012 7:06:35] other: 16 is not too bad.
[05/07/2012 7:06:53] other: I first got drunk when I was quite young - though I forget how young.
[05/07/2012 7:06:56] other: (angel)
[05/07/2012 7:07:00] me: hahahaha
[05/07/2012 7:07:14] other: I was an advanced child, that is all :D
[05/07/2012 7:07:25] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:07:37] me: I've been drinking beer since i was 14
[05/07/2012 7:07:47] me: but there, at 16, I tried absenta
[05/07/2012 7:07:56] me: and that was like a bomb
[05/07/2012 7:08:16] me: some portuguese guay brought it there
[05/07/2012 7:08:19] me: guy
[05/07/2012 7:08:28] other: "Absenta" I am not familiar with - is that the Spanish name?
[05/07/2012 7:08:40] me: yeah, let me look for it
[05/07/2012 7:08:45] other: Absinthe?
[05/07/2012 7:09:07] me: yeah
[05/07/2012 7:09:10] other: Ah yes
[05/07/2012 7:09:10] other: Haha
[05/07/2012 7:09:19] other: It is a good but strong drink, very expensive here and hard to find.
[05/07/2012 7:09:43] me: we had 5 bottles for 5 persons
[05/07/2012 7:09:56] me: and it was nice at the first take
[05/07/2012 7:10:02] me: but after a couple minutes... wohoooo
[05/07/2012 7:10:04] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:10:11] other: Hahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 7:10:34] me: anyway I'm mostly a good boy
[05/07/2012 7:10:47] other: I am mostly good these days too, honestly (angel)
[05/07/2012 7:10:48] me: I just get drunk eventually
[05/07/2012 7:11:01] other: I get drunk sometimes but not too often, it depends on the situation.
[05/07/2012 7:11:12] me: hah! you got stoned not so far ago
[05/07/2012 7:11:13] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:11:19] me: fallen angel
[05/07/2012 7:11:20] me: :D
[05/07/2012 7:11:23] other: Hahahahaha
[05/07/2012 7:11:27] other: True ^-^;
[05/07/2012 7:11:34] other: I was pretty stoned on Saturday night.
[05/07/2012 7:11:41] other: But that was the first time in like a year ^-^;
[05/07/2012 7:11:44] other: So I am not so bad :D
[05/07/2012 7:12:17] me: now that we are talking about first times...
[05/07/2012 7:12:23] me: and my head is kinda hot today...
[05/07/2012 7:12:24] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:12:24] other: XD
[05/07/2012 7:12:36] me: can I ask?
[05/07/2012 7:12:37] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:12:55] other: Ah, well, that's kind of a hard one to answer.
[05/07/2012 7:13:08] me: it is?
[05/07/2012 7:13:15] other: It may make you sad.
[05/07/2012 7:13:30] other: I think of it as having two first times, kind of.
[05/07/2012 7:13:59] me: I want to know you... but if you don't want to tell me it'll be ok
[05/07/2012 7:14:11] other: I don't mind telling you- I was abused when I was quite young.
[05/07/2012 7:14:20] other: I'm OK with it, I mean, I have come to terms with it.
[05/07/2012 7:14:24] other: It no longer bothers me.
[05/07/2012 7:14:26] me: sorry for asking if it was a bad experience
[05/07/2012 7:14:32] other: But I know it's a sad thing to know about.
[05/07/2012 7:14:47] other: It's OK to ask, and I don't mind answering.
[05/07/2012 7:14:56] other: I just always hesitate a little as obviously that can be upsetting.
[05/07/2012 7:15:10] other: But yes, I was abused when I was quite young, so my "first time" I was very, very young.
[05/07/2012 7:15:11] me: you are scaring me a little...
[05/07/2012 7:15:21] me: oh no
[05/07/2012 7:15:21] other: It isn't a scary thing - some people get abused.
[05/07/2012 7:15:24] other: It's sad.
[05/07/2012 7:15:35] other: But it's OK - I mean in MY case it's OK.
[05/07/2012 7:15:36] me: gosh peach...
[05/07/2012 7:15:45] other: Because I'm fine, I'm OK with it, it doesn't bother me any more.
[05/07/2012 7:15:53] other: I just don't always tell people as they find it sad.
[05/07/2012 7:16:06] me: ok, good to know, but I'm not sad, I'm angry
[05/07/2012 7:16:20] other: Try not to feel too upset or angry about it.
[05/07/2012 7:16:34] other: The person responsible went to jail (not for what happened to me, for other reasons) and will die there.
[05/07/2012 7:16:49] other: So I feel like I got justice and am happy enough with that.
[05/07/2012 7:16:56] me: I have no words to describe him...
[05/07/2012 7:17:11] other: It's OK - there aren't any words for him.
[05/07/2012 7:17:15] me: sorry for asking, really
[05/07/2012 7:17:33] other: Don't be - although I should probably mention something somewhat related.
[05/07/2012 7:17:44] other: As you'll likely find out eventually anyway, of course.
[05/07/2012 7:17:47] other: I have a few small scars.
[05/07/2012 7:17:53] other: Nothing big or obvious-
[05/07/2012 7:18:05] other: But I have a few light ones you'd notice if you were looking for them.
[05/07/2012 7:18:23] other: I figure it's probably better to mention that now than you know, if we're in the shower or something.
[05/07/2012 7:18:26] me: I don't mind about scars
[05/07/2012 7:18:37] me: but what caused them... shit
[05/07/2012 7:18:53] other: It was a bad situation when I was young for a few years - but it's OK now.
[05/07/2012 7:18:57] other: And that is what matters.
[05/07/2012 7:19:04] me: ok
[05/07/2012 7:19:10] other: And as much as it is a sad, horrid thing I think maybe it helped make me who I am today.
[05/07/2012 7:19:14] me: you can enjoy sex as anyone else though?
[05/07/2012 7:19:15] other: Our experiences shape us.
[05/07/2012 7:19:21] other: Haha, I can :D
[05/07/2012 7:19:23] other: I assure you.
[05/07/2012 7:19:27] me: then no worries :)
[05/07/2012 7:19:35] other: My other "first time" was a good one if that helps :D
[05/07/2012 7:19:42] me: sure it helps
[05/07/2012 7:19:45] me: ^_^
[05/07/2012 7:19:51] other: How old were you your first time?
[05/07/2012 7:19:54] other: If you don't mind me asking.
[05/07/2012 7:19:57] me: 15
[05/07/2012 7:20:20] me: but I was kinda abused too, but in a good way
[05/07/2012 7:20:33] other: I see ^-^; Does that mean an older woman?
[05/07/2012 7:20:34] me: a 17 year old girl jumped on me without warning
[05/07/2012 7:20:36] other: Hahaha
[05/07/2012 7:20:44] other: I am sure as a 15 year old boy that was exciting :D
[05/07/2012 7:20:47] me: she was very experienced
[05/07/2012 7:20:55] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:20:58] other: Haha
[05/07/2012 7:21:03] other: Well it sounds like a good first time.
[05/07/2012 7:21:07] me: no way
[05/07/2012 7:21:13] me: i was the worst of all xD
[05/07/2012 7:21:21] me: but it was fun
[05/07/2012 7:21:24] other: XD
[05/07/2012 7:21:26] other: Good
[05/07/2012 7:21:33] other: Mine was with an older guy, I was 13 so quite young, but mine was good.
[05/07/2012 7:21:40] me: ^_^
[05/07/2012 7:21:43] other: I'm actually still friends with the guy - but only friends, nothing more.
[05/07/2012 7:21:47] other: He is married with a son now :)
[05/07/2012 7:22:11] me: I don't mind about you having ex that are friends too
[05/07/2012 7:22:14] me: in fact i like it
[05/07/2012 7:22:19] other: Heh, well that's good :)
[05/07/2012 7:22:26] me: if i get to know them they can tell me some tricks about you xD
[05/07/2012 7:22:32] other: Hahahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 7:22:38] other: I better never let you talk to this guy then XD
[05/07/2012 7:22:44] other: He knows far too much about me.
[05/07/2012 7:22:50] other: You will have to learn on your own!
[05/07/2012 7:22:54] me: so you want me to learn on my own?
[05/07/2012 7:22:55] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:23:00] other: Hah, we said the same thing :P
[05/07/2012 7:23:13] me: I'm a good student :*
[05/07/2012 7:23:16] other: "Great minds think alike" - do you know that saying?
[05/07/2012 7:23:19] other: Yes you are :)
[05/07/2012 7:23:24] me: yeah
[05/07/2012 7:23:36] me: and also... get stuck to a genius and something will stick on you
[05/07/2012 7:23:39] me: xD
[05/07/2012 7:23:39] other: Hah, good, because that is what I was going to say when we said the same thing :)
[05/07/2012 7:23:43] other: Hah yes I know that one too :D
[05/07/2012 7:23:57] other: I should be working but I am sleeeeeepy.

[05/07/2012 7:24:21] other: Did you have coffee yet?
[05/07/2012 7:24:23] me: and lay on bed all day
[05/07/2012 7:24:24] other: Hahaha
[05/07/2012 7:24:27] other: I wish.
[05/07/2012 7:24:31] other: I never take time off XD
[05/07/2012 7:24:39] me: eventually you will
[05/07/2012 7:24:41] other: Maybe soon. I feel like I need to do more to move away from c-labs.
[05/07/2012 7:24:53] other: I think Carlos would be proud to see me leave there.
[05/07/2012 7:25:05] me: just if you are ready
[05/07/2012 7:25:11] other: I don't feel appreciated there, etc.
[05/07/2012 7:25:21] me: i don't think he will be proud of you leaving
[05/07/2012 7:25:25] other: Yeah, I hope to get ready over the next month or two, to the point it is the right time.
[05/07/2012 7:25:34] me: he will be proud of you getting ready
[05/07/2012 7:25:40] other: I think he might be proud if I manage to leave and do something else I am better at, etc.
[05/07/2012 7:25:49] me: that's what i meant
[05/07/2012 7:25:50] me: :D
[05/07/2012 7:25:52] other: Hah well I hope so, I am trying hard to prepare.
[05/07/2012 7:25:53] other: Yes :)

[05/07/2012 7:26:37] other: Yes but when you start I believe you will be faster.
[05/07/2012 7:26:47] other: Hah, because my gift is teaching and dealing with people.
[05/07/2012 7:26:50] other: It isn't coding :D

[05/07/2012 7:29:47] other: And you want to leave so you can get there with no rush and hide in the server room.
[05/07/2012 7:29:58] other: Then you can get in before anyone tries to stop you or talk to you or make you do things.
[05/07/2012 7:30:03] other: Then you can hide in there and have your slow day :)
[05/07/2012 7:30:04] me: xD

[05/07/2012 7:31:02] other: That is why being earlier is better, you can sneak past while they are busy setting up for the day.
[05/07/2012 7:31:03] other: Hahahaha :D
[05/07/2012 7:31:10] me: pushing them to get space to keep walking

[06/07/2012 6:56:45] me: a weekly or monthly peach dose with the most asked questions... it could be also a way to promote tutorials and templates
[06/07/2012 6:56:46] other: I don't live in a dark shack now so at least can film properly I suppose.
[06/07/2012 6:57:14] me: hahaha I'll miss your dark side
[06/07/2012 6:57:35] other: Hah my dark side will always lurk somewhere :D

[06/07/2012 6:57:57] me: now time for a test
[06/07/2012 6:58:05] other: It's too chilly here today, I should perhaps wear my scarf inside also.

[06/07/2012 6:59:42] me: xD
[06/07/2012 6:59:57] other: I just have to remember it is double L not double R

[06/07/2012 7:02:25] me: :*
[06/07/2012 7:02:57] me: on a serious note... I've been thinking a lot about what you told me yesterday..
[06/07/2012 7:03:40] me: sure I think it was something horrible, but I won't be sad for it as long as you aren't anymore
[06/07/2012 7:04:24] me: and wanted to thank you for sharing it with me, it means a lot you are being so open with me...
[06/07/2012 7:04:57] me: I won't mention it anymore, but wanted to let you know I appreciate you being so sincere and open
[06/07/2012 7:07:43] other: Back - it's OK, I try to be open with people who are close to me - and honestly, it doesn't bother me any more.
[06/07/2012 7:07:57] me: perfect then
[06/07/2012 7:07:57] other: I know it's a sad thing but try not to dwell on it, it doesn't upset me so it's OK :)
[06/07/2012 7:08:04] other: What time is it there?
[06/07/2012 7:08:18] me: and I really don't care about scars, being big or small ;) I have some flaws too
[06/07/2012 7:08:25] me: 7 am
[06/07/2012 7:08:55] other: I have a few but mostly they're very light, they aren't so obvious. Glad it doesn't worry you :)
[06/07/2012 7:09:03] me: for instance... I have a tooth out of place... just so you know if sometime I close my mouth and a fang is still visible
[06/07/2012 7:09:14] me: sometimes I look like a one fanged vampire
[06/07/2012 7:09:15] me: xD
[06/07/2012 7:09:28] other: Hahaha, that's funny :D
[06/07/2012 7:09:32] other: But fine :)
[06/07/2012 7:09:49] other: I don't know anyone really with perfect teeth, really :)
[06/07/2012 7:10:02] me: as long as it doesn't hurt or bothers me... I really don't mind of fixing it
[06/07/2012 7:10:10] me: but If you wish to I will
[06/07/2012 7:11:07] other: No, of course not :)
[06/07/2012 7:11:11] other: That doesn't worry me.
[06/07/2012 7:11:27] other: I think you are attractive although I do not care about looks - small things like that are nothing.
[06/07/2012 7:11:29] me: I promise I can kiss without biting
[06/07/2012 7:11:34] me: :D
[06/07/2012 7:11:39] other: Haha, well that's good to know :D
[06/07/2012 7:12:17] me: and the other thing that may bother you...
[06/07/2012 7:12:23] me: I'm short...
[06/07/2012 7:12:43] me: maybe not super short but under the average
[06/07/2012 7:13:02] other: I don't mind that either - though am curious, how tall are you?
[06/07/2012 7:13:21] me: I'm scared to tell you
[06/07/2012 7:13:23] other: For the record 2 of my 3 serious exes were shorted than me.
[06/07/2012 7:13:24] me: but well
[06/07/2012 7:13:26] other: :)
[06/07/2012 7:13:30] me: 1.63 m or so
[06/07/2012 7:13:51] other: OK, that isn't that different to my exes. I am 170cm.
[06/07/2012 7:13:53] other: :)
[06/07/2012 7:13:57] other: But I often slouch a little ;)
[06/07/2012 7:14:13] me: so you don't mind about that?
[06/07/2012 7:14:26] other: No, that doesn't bother me at all.
[06/07/2012 7:14:31] me: :'-)
[06/07/2012 7:14:39] other: If you were like a midget it might be weird :P
[06/07/2012 7:14:43] other: But I'd deal with it :D
[06/07/2012 7:14:48] other: But you aren't so it's fine, haha.
[06/07/2012 7:14:50] me: no!
[06/07/2012 7:14:54] me: xD
[06/07/2012 7:15:07] other: I am not that tall anyway, so the difference would be very slight.
[06/07/2012 7:15:13] me: wow i was so scared about that...
[06/07/2012 7:15:16] other: Especially as I don't stand up perfectly straight mostly ;)
[06/07/2012 7:15:20] other: Hah, you don't have to stress about that.
[06/07/2012 7:15:34] other: I should tell you one thing that I have been worried about mentioning too-
[06/07/2012 7:15:39] other: One of my tattoos is for my ex.
[06/07/2012 7:15:48] other: I may get it removed, though, I am not decided yet.
[06/07/2012 7:15:53] me: already knew that ;)
[06/07/2012 7:16:02] other: Hah, had I told you in the past?
[06/07/2012 7:16:06] me: nope
[06/07/2012 7:16:11] other: Oh haha
[06/07/2012 7:16:14] other: How did you know?
[06/07/2012 7:16:17] me: but you told me you have a tatoo I'll probably don't like
[06/07/2012 7:16:25] me: easy to imagine
[06/07/2012 7:16:30] other: I have a couple, one is yes, for my ex.
[06/07/2012 7:16:40] other: It's on my arm. I do have a picture if you'd prefer to know what it looks like?
[06/07/2012 7:16:50] me: oh ok I'm curious
[06/07/2012 7:16:57] me: but I don't mind about it
[06/07/2012 7:17:04] other: One sec, will find it
[06/07/2012 7:17:14] me: if he meant so much for you you should keep it
[06/07/2012 7:17:20] *** other envi 24189_328682731723_6646020_n.jpg ***
[06/07/2012 7:17:21] me: just so you remember good times
[06/07/2012 7:17:32] other: I am still yes, not sure - he did mean a lot to me.
[06/07/2012 7:17:38] other: That is for Dex - his "given name" is Grant.
[06/07/2012 7:17:48] me: ok
[06/07/2012 7:17:59] other: I knew him 10 years and helped him through many things, so it is more about that part of things.
[06/07/2012 7:18:00] me: I can deal with it
[06/07/2012 7:18:01] me: xD
[06/07/2012 7:18:08] other: Hah well that is good to know :)
[06/07/2012 7:18:32] me: I think apart from my height and tooth, you'll probably like everything else
[06/07/2012 7:18:34] me: :D
[06/07/2012 7:18:49] other: Haha, I'm sure :)
[06/07/2012 7:19:12] me: just one little thing
[06/07/2012 7:19:27] me: I can deal with your tatoo but I'll delete the photo, ok?
[06/07/2012 7:19:38] other: Yeah that's fine :)
[06/07/2012 7:19:52] me: :)
[06/07/2012 7:20:07] me: thank youfor showing me
[06/07/2012 7:20:16] other: That's OK, figured you should know what it looked like.
[06/07/2012 7:20:26] me: so what's the other tatoo I probably won't like?
[06/07/2012 7:20:28] me: xD
[06/07/2012 7:20:31] other: It's on my right upper arm and usually covered anyway.
[06/07/2012 7:20:40] me: for Carlos? or maybe Corona?
[06/07/2012 7:20:42] me: xD
[06/07/2012 7:20:45] other: Hah I have other tattoos but none you'll not like for whatever reason :P
[06/07/2012 7:20:45] other: Hah
[06/07/2012 7:20:50] other: I would like one for Carlos one day.
[06/07/2012 7:20:55] other: But never tell him I said that.
[06/07/2012 7:20:59] other: Never ever XD
[06/07/2012 7:21:00] me: late
[06/07/2012 7:21:12] me: I'm talking with him right now
[06/07/2012 7:21:13] other: I like the idea of getting them for important people in my life.
[06/07/2012 7:21:18] other: Hah
[06/07/2012 7:21:38] other: I am sort of talking with him, a little, not much - kind of in the background.
[06/07/2012 7:21:39] me: noew he knows you want to put his face in your ass
[06/07/2012 7:21:43] me: now

[06/07/2012 7:26:51] me: but i may fall unconscious
[06/07/2012 7:27:09] me: that's what happens when someone finally manages to put a needle on me
[06/07/2012 7:27:09] other: I know lots of people who are really scared of needles, don't worry :)
[06/07/2012 7:27:20] me: that's the thing... I'm not scared

[06/07/2012 13:57:51] me: I do too
[06/07/2012 13:58:00] me: but lately I try to be far from it
[06/07/2012 13:58:02] me: just in case
[06/07/2012 13:58:10] other: Maybe I will be not nutritious because people who try to feed on me will get high XD
[06/07/2012 13:58:20] me: HAHHAHAHA
[06/07/2012 13:58:26] other: Are you worried about smoking normal pot being a problem for you because of past issues?
[06/07/2012 13:58:33] other: Or you are just worried you will encounter that kind again?
[06/07/2012 13:58:56] me: I'm vicious

[06/07/2012 13:59:49] other: I don't smoke pot often at all, it's rare and I don't need it.
[06/07/2012 13:59:54] other: Normal tobacco I do love though :D
[06/07/2012 14:00:13] me: hehe
[06/07/2012 14:00:16] me: no worries at any of them

[06/07/2012 14:56:23] me: no worries
[06/07/2012 14:56:29] other: (My phone was silent as it was in a cheap Chinese charging dock ;))
[06/07/2012 14:56:31] me: I won't do anything until you answer back
[06/07/2012 14:56:43] other: I will read them now :)
[06/07/2012 14:56:47] me: haha
[06/07/2012 14:56:49] me: ok
[06/07/2012 14:57:29] other: I read it - no, you can't mention anything about him talking about hiring me, sorry :(
[06/07/2012 14:57:38] me: ok
[06/07/2012 14:57:46] me: I'll have to find a workaround then
[06/07/2012 14:57:48] other: That I know him is OK, that I think he's cool is OK, and even maybe the fact I have mentioned a desire to work with Moai - all that is OK.
[06/07/2012 14:58:03] other: You *can* say I have mentioned that I'd like to work with Moai/Todd.
[06/07/2012 14:58:04] me: oh nice
[06/07/2012 14:58:19] me: i think that'll be enough
[06/07/2012 14:58:23] other: But *nothing* about him wanting to hire me, etc.
[06/07/2012 14:58:24] other: :)
[06/07/2012 14:58:32] me: and if he asks how i know...
[06/07/2012 14:58:41] other: You can say I told you.
[06/07/2012 14:58:54] other: You and I are friends, it isn't unusual that I would tell you that I would like to work with Moai at some point.
[06/07/2012 14:58:59] me: i was thinking in telling him you'd be my future wife hahaha
[06/07/2012 14:59:00] me: xD
[06/07/2012 14:59:17] other: Hahahaha :D
[06/07/2012 14:59:28] other: He might be surprised by that, I believe he thinks I've always been single.
[06/07/2012 14:59:37] other: He asked me about ties to here, you see, when talking about the future.
[06/07/2012 14:59:47] other: I said I had none because I knew I would leave Dex eventually.
[06/07/2012 14:59:48] me: hahaha
[06/07/2012 14:59:48] other: XD
[06/07/2012 14:59:54] other: So he will think you moved quick since then :D
[06/07/2012 15:00:02] me: :)
[06/07/2012 15:00:17] me: I won't tell him, but I really hope it becomes true
[06/07/2012 15:00:31] other: But yeah, do not even allude to him hiring me - OK? But you *can* say I have expressed interest in working with Moai, think it's awesome SDK, etc.
[06/07/2012 15:00:42] other: Haha well there is a lot of time for that ^-^;
[06/07/2012 15:00:44] me: I get the point don't worry
[06/07/2012 15:00:51] other: Good :)
[06/07/2012 15:00:57] other: Sorry you can't mention that part of it.
[06/07/2012 15:01:05] me: it doesn't matter
[06/07/2012 15:01:06] other: I know it would have been easier. I appreciate you checking with me first.
[06/07/2012 15:01:21] me: saying we are good friends and you helped with the interview will sure be enough
[06/07/2012 15:01:43] other: Heh don't tell him I helped with the interview - he will think I am prodding him indirectly ;)
[06/07/2012 15:01:50] me: I don't like his answers about newcomers >_<
[06/07/2012 15:01:53] other: I'm not, but he'd think I was.
[06/07/2012 15:01:57] other: I know, me either.
[06/07/2012 15:01:59] me: oooook
[06/07/2012 15:02:03] other: Sorry XD
[06/07/2012 15:02:12] me: restricting Peachy!
[06/07/2012 15:02:13] me: xD
[06/07/2012 15:02:22] other: Hah, at least I tell you these things :)
[06/07/2012 15:02:25] other: Most people have no idea.
[06/07/2012 15:02:38] other: Most people don't know I know Todd, that I introduced him and Carlos, that I may work for them, etc :D
[06/07/2012 15:02:52] me: hahaha
[06/07/2012 15:02:54] me: ok ok
[06/07/2012 15:02:58] me: I can work with that
[06/07/2012 15:03:06] me: just a little harder but no worries
[06/07/2012 15:03:08] other: You have the benefit of knowledge, even if it must be kept a secret ;)
[06/07/2012 15:03:10] other: Sorry XD
[06/07/2012 15:03:22] me: I only know we are good friends and you mentioned you are interested in Moai
[06/07/2012 15:03:49] other: We're good friends and I told you that I have a keen interest in Moai, would like to work with it some day, yes.
[06/07/2012 15:03:51] other: :)
[06/07/2012 15:04:00] me: nice
[06/07/2012 15:04:04] other: And you know that I know Todd and think he's a good guy, if that helps.
[06/07/2012 15:04:05] other: :D
[06/07/2012 15:04:12] me: you know I'm thinking about something...
[06/07/2012 15:04:16] other: We are both Australian after all ^-^;
[06/07/2012 15:04:17] other: Yes?
[06/07/2012 15:04:25] me: maybe...
[06/07/2012 15:04:27] me: just maybe
[06/07/2012 15:04:31] me: at some point
[06/07/2012 15:04:38] me: we are able to realise Javier's dream
[06/07/2012 15:04:46] other: What is Javier's dream? :)
[06/07/2012 15:04:54] me: a corona killer sdk, a wrapper for Moai with Corona's same syntax
[06/07/2012 15:05:01] me: just like rapanui
[06/07/2012 15:05:06] me: but exactly as corona
[06/07/2012 15:05:12] other: I think that would be very cool, rapanui I have only briefly looked at and am not so keen on.
[06/07/2012 15:05:15] me: so people just have to copypaste their code
[06/07/2012 15:05:24] other: But yes - I think that would be AWESOME. I have thought about it myself but do not know enough yet.
[06/07/2012 15:05:27] other: Still so noob :D
[06/07/2012 15:05:42] me: we'll get there ;)
[06/07/2012 15:05:43] other: It would be wonderful though. So many possibilities.
[06/07/2012 15:05:46] other: I hope so, together :)
[06/07/2012 15:05:54] other: You must get back to work I think, though?
[06/07/2012 15:06:03] me: yeah, no way I'm going to Moai if you aren't there haha
[06/07/2012 15:06:09] me: yeah...
[06/07/2012 15:06:10] me: sadly
[06/07/2012 15:06:13] other: Hah, good :D
[06/07/2012 15:06:15] other: I know
[06/07/2012 15:06:17] other: It's OK though.
[06/07/2012 15:06:20] other: We will talk again soon.
[06/07/2012 15:06:21] other: :)
[06/07/2012 15:06:25] me: yep
[06/07/2012 15:06:36] me: tomorrow I'll be out of home for a few hours
[06/07/2012 15:06:45] me: going to visit mum and take photos for the passport
[06/07/2012 15:06:49] other: That's OK, I might sleep in a bit.
[06/07/2012 15:06:52] other: I hope you have a nice time.
[06/07/2012 15:06:56] me: but I'll be there early and again before you sleep
[06/07/2012 15:06:56] other: Tell her that I am not imaginary!
[06/07/2012 15:06:59] other: LD
[06/07/2012 15:07:02] other: :D*
[06/07/2012 15:07:02] me: hahahaha
[06/07/2012 15:07:06] me: no no
[06/07/2012 15:07:18] me: I prefer to astonish her introducing you eventually
[06/07/2012 15:07:33] other: "Peach is real! She lives in Australia and writes code and is a famous nerd girl!"
[06/07/2012 15:07:34] other: ;)
[06/07/2012 15:07:35] other: Haha
[06/07/2012 15:07:37] other: Very well :)
[06/07/2012 15:07:43] me: she's real... and she's here!

[06/07/2012 19:03:14] other: Unfortunately not really. Most left are not ones that need code, just general advice from me.
[06/07/2012 19:03:19] me: ok
[06/07/2012 19:03:21] other: One I am replying now is an idiot.

[06/07/2012 19:03:35] me: what did he told you?
[06/07/2012 19:03:57] other: Subject was "Tweet to Download"
[06/07/2012 19:04:01] other: Message:
Hello,

I am interested in looking at the novice tutorials that you made for corona but I do not have a twitter account and I don't really want to make one. So this means that I can't download your files at all now.  It would be great if you gave an alternative download source for non twitter users. 

It is to much work for me to sign up for a service I don't want to download your files, plus it would be tweeted on an account with no followers. I totally understand that you want more exposure but I think you are also losing a lot by limiting who can download your tutorials.

Regards,
Grant
[06/07/2012 19:04:36] me: HAHAHAHAHAHA
[06/07/2012 19:05:05] me: if you are a developer and don't have twitter you won't go far my friend...
[06/07/2012 19:05:14] other: He said it was too much work!
[06/07/2012 19:05:18] other: To sign up for Twitter!

[06/07/2012 19:05:51] other: Hahahahaha :D
[06/07/2012 19:05:58] other: His password is probably "password" :P
[06/07/2012 19:06:05] other: No wait that would be too hard.
[06/07/2012 19:06:08] me: that's too long!
[06/07/2012 19:06:08] other: It's probably "pass"
[06/07/2012 19:06:10] me: xD
[06/07/2012 19:06:13] other: Or "p"
[06/07/2012 19:06:14] other: :D

[07/07/2012 7:18:12] other: That is probably a good thing today.
[07/07/2012 7:18:16] other: Just because I have so much work to do :D
[07/07/2012 7:18:19] me: xD

[07/07/2012 7:18:54] me: fair enough
[07/07/2012 7:19:03] me: I get distracted just with your pic
[07/07/2012 7:19:12] other: Stupid people... this comment on corona for newbies;
[07/07/2012 7:19:18] other: I don't have twitter (and don't want it)-- could I please obtain the link?
[07/07/2012 7:19:20] other: >.<'
[07/07/2012 7:19:21] me: weather is fresh this morning. while yesterday was horribly hot
[07/07/2012 7:19:31] other: Glad it isn't too hot when you have to drive.
[07/07/2012 7:19:37] me: oh god
[07/07/2012 7:19:47] other: People can be such greedy idiots.
[07/07/2012 7:19:54] me: they spend more energy at reply that it could to take the account
[07/07/2012 7:19:57] other: I know.
[07/07/2012 7:20:08] other: I think I may just start ignoring them and not approving those comments.
[07/07/2012 7:20:16] me: I second that
[07/07/2012 7:20:18] other: It's too frustrating - they already get it for *free*
[07/07/2012 7:20:27] other: And it's only on like 6 or 7 tutes of dozens upon dozens.
[07/07/2012 7:20:29] me: but maybe also making an statement too
[07/07/2012 7:20:51] other: I could offer a paid download for those who don't want to tweet, haha.
[07/07/2012 7:20:58] me: you know something like saying from now on this is this way and I won't do it any other way
[07/07/2012 7:21:10] other: People have suggested that before, a cheap one, but to make it clear they can get it for free or not, it's up to them.
[07/07/2012 7:21:30] other: I have to think about that, yeah.
[07/07/2012 7:21:50] me: of course not everyone would read it
[07/07/2012 7:22:01] other: Yes, that's true. Hmmm. We will see.
[07/07/2012 7:22:03] me: but it will be there in case they bother
[07/07/2012 7:22:18] other: Yeah, I might do that.
[07/07/2012 7:22:23] other: I am too sleepy to think much about it.
[07/07/2012 7:22:25] other: So many emails XD
[07/07/2012 7:22:26] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 7:22:43] me: if you do it, try to point that twitter is very important in this world
[07/07/2012 7:22:57] me: so in a way you are helping with that too
[07/07/2012 7:22:59] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 7:23:12] other: Heh
[07/07/2012 7:23:17] other: That's true :)
[07/07/2012 7:23:19] other: ;)
[07/07/2012 7:23:32] me: nothing like slaping a face with style
[07/07/2012 7:23:35] other: I am a bit hungry but also lazzzzzzzy.
[07/07/2012 7:23:37] other: Haha :D
[07/07/2012 7:23:38] other: True
[07/07/2012 7:24:00] me: health first! you should eat something
[07/07/2012 7:24:11] other: I should but am lazy :D
[07/07/2012 7:24:18] me: bite my left arm
[07/07/2012 7:24:23] me: I don't use it so much
[07/07/2012 7:24:23] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 7:24:25] other: XD
[07/07/2012 7:24:30] other: I am not a cannibal :D
[07/07/2012 7:24:41] me: xD
[07/07/2012 7:24:54] me: I can offer you two legs and one arm
[07/07/2012 7:25:01] me: just in case you get too hungry
[07/07/2012 7:25:02] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 7:25:12] other: I will be OK I think, I think my mother will make me toast in a little.
[07/07/2012 7:25:12] me: everything else I want to keep it xD
[07/07/2012 7:25:18] other: Hahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 7:25:26] other: That's probably a good idea, you might need it XD
[07/07/2012 7:25:50] me: :)
[07/07/2012 7:26:04] me: you know if you were here you'd have me in the kitchen right now?
[07/07/2012 7:26:14] other: Haha I know :D
[07/07/2012 7:26:21] other: You would feed me well I'm sure.
[07/07/2012 7:26:27] other: Which is good as I never feed myself so well.
[07/07/2012 7:26:29] me: what do you usually have for breakfast?
[07/07/2012 7:26:36] me: well no
[07/07/2012 7:26:45] other: Toast I suppose.
[07/07/2012 7:26:48] me: what would you want to have for breakfast?
[07/07/2012 7:27:02] other: Haha well, I don't know - I like most things :)
[07/07/2012 7:27:07] other: I am partial to bacon ;)
[07/07/2012 7:27:34] me: bacon and eggs? and a couple toasts, some juice and a cofee?
[07/07/2012 7:27:37] me: enough?
[07/07/2012 7:27:46] other: Haha yes that would be most enjoyable ^-^;
[07/07/2012 7:27:54] other: Much better than just toast ;)
[07/07/2012 7:28:08] me: Ok!
[07/07/2012 7:28:21] me: have to get something so you can eat comfy from the bed
[07/07/2012 7:28:24] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 7:28:29] other: Hahahaha
[07/07/2012 7:28:32] other: I would like that :D
[07/07/2012 7:28:54] other: I must stop thinking about food and relaxing in bed though.
[07/07/2012 7:29:03] me: :)
[07/07/2012 7:29:04] other: XD I should be working hard now! hah.
[07/07/2012 7:29:14] me: ok, I'll let you work
[07/07/2012 7:29:24] me: hopefully you'll be free when I come back
[07/07/2012 7:29:30] other: We will chat later I'm sure, yes :)
[07/07/2012 7:29:33] me: but it will be late in your night :(
[07/07/2012 7:29:38] me: 11 pm or so
[07/07/2012 7:29:40] other: That might be OK.
[07/07/2012 7:29:48] other: I think I should be around then :)
[07/07/2012 7:29:55] other: I didn't fall asleep until almost 5 am
[07/07/2012 7:30:00] other: I went to bed but didn't sleep for 2 hours.
[07/07/2012 7:30:11] other: So I should probably still be up at 11 tonight easily, I think :)
[07/07/2012 7:30:21] me: ^_^
[07/07/2012 7:30:28] me: you should rest more...
[07/07/2012 7:30:31] me: but ok

[07/07/2012 7:34:10] other: Yes?
[07/07/2012 7:34:23] me: what do you think about me trying to make a super simple space invaders clone?
[07/07/2012 7:34:43] me: movement, sound, collisions, tables and scene changes
[07/07/2012 7:34:51] me: that's what I want to cover
[07/07/2012 7:34:55] other: I think it's certainly worth a shot - I am nowhere near that point yet, nowhere near it, but I think it is a cool idea.
[07/07/2012 7:34:56] me: and make it as easy as I can
[07/07/2012 7:35:01] other: Don't overdo it.
[07/07/2012 7:35:14] other: Toast is ready so I must run
[07/07/2012 7:35:18] me: :D
[07/07/2012 7:35:19] other: But yes, good idea, just don't work too hard.

[07/07/2012 14:57:26] other: Welcome home :)
[07/07/2012 14:57:31] other: How was your mother?
[07/07/2012 14:57:37] me: better
[07/07/2012 14:57:41] me: :)
[07/07/2012 14:57:51] me: not so worried about his husband...
[07/07/2012 14:58:00] me: yeah he is the one who has cancer
[07/07/2012 14:58:05] me: it's been like a dad for me
[07/07/2012 14:58:29] me: but now he can stay at home and do 'normal' life
[07/07/2012 14:58:34] me: so it's good
[07/07/2012 14:58:36] other: Oh that sounds nice.
[07/07/2012 14:58:42] other: Whose husband is he, sorry?
[07/07/2012 14:58:47] me: my mother's
[07/07/2012 14:58:48] me: xD
[07/07/2012 14:59:00] other: Wait XD He is your mothers husband but he is also your uncle?
[07/07/2012 14:59:05] me: no
[07/07/2012 14:59:10] me: both of them are sick...
[07/07/2012 14:59:14] other: I am sorry, I am a little confused.
[07/07/2012 14:59:20] other: Oh, that is not good (worry)
[07/07/2012 14:59:28] other: I am sorry, I didn't realize her husband was not well I don't think.
[07/07/2012 14:59:31] other: Only your uncle.
[07/07/2012 14:59:35] other: I was very confused for a minute there.
[07/07/2012 14:59:36] me: no worries
[07/07/2012 14:59:47] other: I thought she must have married your father's brother for a minute there, I admit.
[07/07/2012 14:59:48] me: I haven't talked openly about it
[07/07/2012 14:59:57] other: I will remember now though.
[07/07/2012 15:00:04] other: I am glad that at least one of them is doing OK.
[07/07/2012 15:00:22] me: in fact my uncle has expectations to get healed
[07/07/2012 15:00:32] me: but my mother's husband hasn't
[07/07/2012 15:00:36] other: I hope it wasn't too emotionally tiring for you today. I may be visiting a friend in hospital tomorrow myself, though I am not sure yet.
[07/07/2012 15:00:41] other: I hope that soon they will both be well.
[07/07/2012 15:00:41] me: so one is just waiting but the other can be saved
[07/07/2012 15:01:11] me: don't worry at all
[07/07/2012 15:01:23] me: you get my emotions on the right spot ;)
[07/07/2012 15:01:29] other: Heh, well that is good :)

[07/07/2012 15:02:02] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 15:02:12] me: probably you'll find it in your email tomorrow morning
[07/07/2012 15:02:19] other: I will be up a fair time yet I expect, so take your time.
[07/07/2012 15:02:22] other: Yes, or tomorrow :D

[07/07/2012 15:02:42] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:02:44] other: I might go for a cig, haven't had one in a bit - still doing forum right now. Brb
[07/07/2012 15:02:46] other: OOOOH!

[07/07/2012 15:08:46] me: it works
[07/07/2012 15:08:46] other: I may be a little slow for a bit though, as I am still doing the forum prior to sending my report.
[07/07/2012 15:08:56] other: Heh, anything you have done will be very impressive to me I am sure.
[07/07/2012 15:09:01] other: I have done so little myself so far.
[07/07/2012 15:09:17] me: what I've done may be hard for you to watch at first
[07/07/2012 15:09:20] me: but don't get scared
[07/07/2012 15:09:27] me: I've tried to do a game template
[07/07/2012 15:09:27] other: I do hope to gain the skills to write something like rapanui as we discussed earlier, though. Admittedly out of spite :D
[07/07/2012 15:09:38] other: I will find it a little scary at least, I am sure. :D
[07/07/2012 15:09:48] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 15:09:54] me: WE CAN do it
[07/07/2012 15:09:58] other: (For the record I am not normally spiteful, it is reserved for very specific circumstances.)
[07/07/2012 15:10:03] other: I would love to do that together if we could.
[07/07/2012 15:10:15] me: we can, there's no doubt
[07/07/2012 15:10:18] other: Can you imagine if I put that on Techority and pulled down Corona tutorials?
[07/07/2012 15:10:21] me: and I can't do it alone
[07/07/2012 15:10:24] other: Imagine W's reaction :D
[07/07/2012 15:10:29] me: I need you a lot for this
[07/07/2012 15:10:39] other: Heh well I hope so. I don't want to be useless.
[07/07/2012 15:10:39] other: ^-^;
[07/07/2012 15:10:44] me: no really
[07/07/2012 15:10:50] me: I think too much as a programmer
[07/07/2012 15:10:51] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:10:53] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 15:10:54] me: today I've realised
[07/07/2012 15:11:13] other: Well, even if my technical skills may be lacking I do have other good skills - whatever we make I can get seen by people, that is a good thing.
[07/07/2012 15:11:21] other: I don't think enough like a programmer ;)
[07/07/2012 15:11:33] me: you have to teach me to code easy ^_^
[07/07/2012 15:11:40] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 15:11:51] other: Yes, between us hopefully we can find a nice middle ground.
[07/07/2012 15:11:58] other: Something people will be able to understand, something I can teach them about.
[07/07/2012 15:11:59] me: nono
[07/07/2012 15:12:04] me: totally your ground
[07/07/2012 15:12:05] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:12:08] other: Hahaha :D
[07/07/2012 15:12:09] me: mine is screwed up
[07/07/2012 15:12:26] other: We will find something that works best, whatever that is.
[07/07/2012 15:12:39] me: sure
[07/07/2012 15:12:42] other: Then, eventually, we will have something to share with the community :)
[07/07/2012 15:12:52] me: BUT
[07/07/2012 15:12:59] me: I want to see w face
[07/07/2012 15:13:00] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:13:04] other: So do I, so much :D
[07/07/2012 15:13:19] other: We will not be able to, of course - but I will know of his reaction.
[07/07/2012 15:13:20] me: so someone in the office has jo know about this eventually and help us
[07/07/2012 15:13:21] me: xD

[07/07/2012 15:15:01] me: really sorry about that
[07/07/2012 15:15:04] other: That's OK, I didn't mind, I just wanted to explain that I didn't.
[07/07/2012 15:15:10] other: I didn't mind :) I just wanted to explain.
[07/07/2012 15:15:18] other: It takes me a long time to start doing things in the morning.
[07/07/2012 15:15:23] other: I work but only simple things.
[07/07/2012 15:15:25] me: ok
[07/07/2012 15:15:30] other: I don't do any emails which is why I don't reply before you are up normally.
[07/07/2012 15:15:32] other: :)
[07/07/2012 15:15:41] me: :)
[07/07/2012 15:15:54] other: I do spend longer in bed than you do, though.
[07/07/2012 15:15:59] other: Even if I don't sleep longer.
[07/07/2012 15:16:02] other: So you were half right :)
[07/07/2012 15:16:22] me: maybe but I hope you know I think you work hard and in a dedicated way

[07/07/2012 15:22:00] other: I am glad you know I work hard in a dedicated way, some people don't realize that :)
[07/07/2012 15:22:06] other: Tic, uhm... like "sec"
[07/07/2012 15:22:15] me: oh ok
[07/07/2012 15:22:19] other: As in "one sec" means "one second"
[07/07/2012 15:22:26] me: ok got it
[07/07/2012 15:22:32] other: "One tic" is more an English expression.
[07/07/2012 15:22:33] other: :D
[07/07/2012 15:22:36] me: there's something wrong with Moai
[07/07/2012 15:22:40] me: I found a bug!
[07/07/2012 15:22:41] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:22:47] other: Hahahaha did you? XD
[07/07/2012 15:22:57] me: not at all, but it's something missing
[07/07/2012 15:23:13] me: sound can't be played in windows if you don't download an additional module
[07/07/2012 15:23:19] me: it works fine on amc though
[07/07/2012 15:23:22] me: mac

[07/07/2012 15:23:46] me: no compromise
[07/07/2012 15:23:46] other: It's funny because on Windows I think it's easier to actually run Moai, right?
[07/07/2012 15:23:58] me: it's the same...
[07/07/2012 15:24:06] other: I hate PC. Hate it. I would like it more if I had a fancy one, haha.
[07/07/2012 15:24:15] me: you can double click the simulator but that's all
[07/07/2012 15:24:31] other: I can't remember, it has been awhile.
[07/07/2012 15:24:37] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:24:39] other: I tried a super early version on PC.
[07/07/2012 15:24:48] other: That was a long time ago.
[07/07/2012 15:24:49] me: at least don't hate me for working with it
[07/07/2012 15:24:51] other: Like 15 months I think.
[07/07/2012 15:24:57] other: Haha I don't :D Te amo.

[07/07/2012 15:26:05] other: ^-^;
[07/07/2012 15:26:16] other: I am afraid when I am working on the forum no one can get close - my hands move too fast.
[07/07/2012 15:26:26] other: You are liable to get elbowed or something in my frenzy :D
[07/07/2012 15:26:33] me: haha I can grab your feet
[07/07/2012 15:26:40] me: and get them warm
[07/07/2012 15:26:43] me: :D
[07/07/2012 15:26:48] other: That is also somewhat unsafe ^-^;
[07/07/2012 15:26:53] other: I should say I have very tickly feet.
[07/07/2012 15:26:56] other: VERY tickly.
[07/07/2012 15:26:59] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 15:26:59] other: And I don't like being tickled.
[07/07/2012 15:27:00] other: XD
[07/07/2012 15:27:12] me: we'll see
[07/07/2012 15:27:14] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 15:27:22] other: You have to be careful, I sometimes kick out when people try to tickle me.
[07/07/2012 15:27:28] other: Not on purpose - just a reflex XD
[07/07/2012 15:27:35] other: It is a dangerous thing :D
[07/07/2012 15:27:46] me: I can stand a bleeding nose every now or then
[07/07/2012 15:27:48] me: xD
[07/07/2012 15:27:56] other: ^-^;

[07/07/2012 15:28:19] me: twitter?
[07/07/2012 15:28:24] other: I want to turn my phone off but I never do that. It is only off when I fly.
[07/07/2012 15:28:27] other: No, text messages.
[07/07/2012 15:28:28] other: Like sms.
[07/07/2012 15:28:40] other: (mp)
[07/07/2012 15:28:41] me: the price of fame..
[07/07/2012 15:28:58] other: It's one guy right now - not someone I worked with.
[07/07/2012 15:29:13] other: Guy in Sydney I knew, casual friend, not particularly close.
[07/07/2012 15:29:19] me: another crushed heart?
[07/07/2012 15:29:20] other: He thinks now I'm single I will date him.
[07/07/2012 15:29:23] other: Yes >.<'
[07/07/2012 15:29:29] me: U_U
[07/07/2012 15:29:39] other: I'm not going to date him, lol, don't worry.
[07/07/2012 15:29:48] other: It's just he seems to think he has a shot because I'm single, or whatever.
[07/07/2012 15:29:56] other: But I am *not* interested in him.
[07/07/2012 15:30:03] me: ok...
[07/07/2012 15:30:24] me: I think I would have to learn dealing with you being pursued everyday
[07/07/2012 15:30:36] other: Hah, well, it happens a lot ^-^; So yes.
[07/07/2012 15:30:40] other: But I am very loyal.

[07/07/2012 15:30:53] other: :)
[07/07/2012 15:31:01] other: It's just part of being a girl in a sea of nerds ;)

[07/07/2012 15:33:10] me: I think more without makeup
[07/07/2012 15:33:23] other: I know ^-^; Heh.
[07/07/2012 15:33:41] other: Don't think I have forgotten that eventually you must tell me more about your makeup discussion :P Who started it, etc.
[07/07/2012 15:33:47] me: of course I dont mind if you want to paint yourself
[07/07/2012 15:33:48] other: Not now, but I haven't forgotten :D
[07/07/2012 15:33:51] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 15:33:56] other: Sometimes I will wear it.
[07/07/2012 15:34:02] other: Just not a huge amount.
[07/07/2012 15:34:06] me: no worries, it looks awesome too
[07/07/2012 15:34:12] me: but you are beautiful
[07/07/2012 15:34:16] me: without anything on
[07/07/2012 15:34:23] other: HAHAHAHA I read that differently to how you meant it.
[07/07/2012 15:34:30] other: But that was sweet, thank you :D
[07/07/2012 15:34:37] me: no, you read it right xD
[07/07/2012 15:34:41] other: I just read it differently for a second XD
[07/07/2012 15:34:46] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 15:34:53] other: You don't know yet what I look like with nothing on.
[07/07/2012 15:35:01] other: Mostly because I can't have pictures of me out in the wild XD
[07/07/2012 15:35:09] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 15:35:20] me: I have a good eye ;)
[07/07/2012 15:35:24] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 15:35:36] other: I should spend more time on the forum, am not done yet.
[07/07/2012 15:35:46] me: ok, let's have a little break
[07/07/2012 15:35:50] other: I am distracting myself with you as usual.
[07/07/2012 15:35:52] me: I will code a little more too
[07/07/2012 15:35:55] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 15:35:57] other: Yes, I will go for a cig then do more on the forum :)
[07/07/2012 15:35:58] me: I'm sorry!
[07/07/2012 15:36:04] other: Haha it's not your fault.
[07/07/2012 15:36:10] other: We'll talk again shortly :)
[07/07/2012 15:36:13] me: ok, when you want to distract I'm here
[07/07/2012 15:36:18] me: :* Love you!
[07/07/2012 15:36:20] other: Good :D
[07/07/2012 15:36:23] other: Te amo caballero.
[07/07/2012 16:00:53] me: ...yesterday I was watching your boggle series at night... I love how you fiddle around the code when a bug happens ^_^
[07/07/2012 16:01:12] other: Hahaha :D
[07/07/2012 16:01:30] other: I try not to embarass myself too much ;)
[07/07/2012 16:01:35] other: I was thinking more about Peach TV earlier :D
[07/07/2012 16:01:41] other: I like the idea.
[07/07/2012 16:01:49] me: ^_^
[07/07/2012 16:01:52] me: I love it
[07/07/2012 16:02:00] me: and the name is sooo fucking great
[07/07/2012 16:02:05] me: it has to happen
[07/07/2012 16:02:22] other: Hahaha it is, but I wonder how I'd go if I did it now.
[07/07/2012 16:02:31] other: If it were about coding it would be Corona right now - and that might be odd.
[07/07/2012 16:02:51] me: then we'll have to code some templates and tutos before that
[07/07/2012 16:02:53] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 16:02:56] me: soon
[07/07/2012 16:03:01] other: Haha, indeed :D
[07/07/2012 16:03:02] me: so soon you won't notice
[07/07/2012 16:03:14] other: It would be easier if I wasn't working all the damn time.
[07/07/2012 16:03:19] other: >.<'
[07/07/2012 16:03:33] other: I need more time to do Moai stuff. I am going to start slacking off a bit soon I think :D
[07/07/2012 16:03:38] other: W probably wouldn't even notice.
[07/07/2012 16:03:43] other: And they underpay me so much anyway.
[07/07/2012 16:03:45] other: I wouldn't feel bad ;)
[07/07/2012 16:04:01] me: can I ask what your pay is?
[07/07/2012 16:04:06] me: i mean how much?
[07/07/2012 16:04:14] me: or isn't something you want to share
[07/07/2012 16:04:17] me: I'll understand
[07/07/2012 16:04:17] other: You can ask - and I'm happy to tell you, but naturally it stays between us.
[07/07/2012 16:04:29] me: you know it will
[07/07/2012 16:04:37] other: No, I am VERY open about money stuff. Too many people aren't and it is stupid amongst friends to hide it.
[07/07/2012 16:04:45] other: I'm almost embarassed by how low it is -
[07/07/2012 16:04:47] other: but $20 per hour.
[07/07/2012 16:04:56] me: O.o
[07/07/2012 16:04:59] me: really?
[07/07/2012 16:05:05] other: Others in the company make a lot more than I do and are still underpaid.
[07/07/2012 16:05:21] me: that is soooo low Peach!
[07/07/2012 16:05:28] other: One, who does stuff a little harder than what I do but not so much, and certainly doesn't do as much overtime etc, he makes $50 an hour.
[07/07/2012 16:05:33] me: let me do some maths
[07/07/2012 16:05:42] other: It's $1600 a fortnight.
[07/07/2012 16:05:45] other: $3200 a month.
[07/07/2012 16:05:54] me: hahahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:05:57] me: xDDDDDDDDDDD
[07/07/2012 16:06:00] other: 38,400 a year.
[07/07/2012 16:06:02] other: I think.
[07/07/2012 16:06:02] me: I've done maths
[07/07/2012 16:06:09] me: I get 12.5 per hour
[07/07/2012 16:06:25] other: Yes, although I suppose it is different there.
[07/07/2012 16:06:27] other: With the cost of living.
[07/07/2012 16:06:36] other: Your rent is less than $1000 a month I think you said?
[07/07/2012 16:06:45] me: I thought I was making more xD
[07/07/2012 16:06:48] me: yes
[07/07/2012 16:06:49] me: 600
[07/07/2012 16:06:56] other: Australia and the US are both a LOT more than that.
[07/07/2012 16:06:58] other: Even for one room.
[07/07/2012 16:07:09] me: that means...
[07/07/2012 16:07:09] other: And other things cost more too I think.
[07/07/2012 16:07:14] me: if you come here
[07/07/2012 16:07:20] me: you are inmediately rich!
[07/07/2012 16:07:21] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:07:22] other: Hahahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 16:07:31] other: Well that would be kind of cool XD
[07/07/2012 16:07:39] other: How much do your cigarettes cost?
[07/07/2012 16:07:55] me: a package of 10 costs 40 euros
[07/07/2012 16:08:08] me: i mean a package of 10 packages
[07/07/2012 16:08:08] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:08:18] other: How many cigs in a pack there?
[07/07/2012 16:08:22] me: 20
[07/07/2012 16:08:27] other: (Here there can be 20, 25 or 30)
[07/07/2012 16:08:38] other: OK so that's 200 cigarettes for less than $50.
[07/07/2012 16:08:43] me: oh here too, but I go the usual way
[07/07/2012 16:08:56] other: Here 200 cigarettes costs .... Uhm, let me find my receipt
[07/07/2012 16:09:08] other: $132.45
[07/07/2012 16:09:26] other: Because in Australia the government are lying tax grabbing bastards XD
[07/07/2012 16:09:30] me: just crapped my pants
[07/07/2012 16:09:33] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 16:09:45] other: When we Skype call (soon I hope) then I will explain how that works here.
[07/07/2012 16:09:50] other: It is the same with alcohol.
[07/07/2012 16:10:03] other: What does a loaf of bread cost there?
[07/07/2012 16:10:06] me: you can get a beer for 60 cents here
[07/07/2012 16:10:12] other: Hahahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 16:10:16] me: I don't know about bread
[07/07/2012 16:10:28] other: Here that would NEVER happen.
[07/07/2012 16:10:40] other: Do you know how much for a can of Rum and Coke, or Jack and Coke or the like?
[07/07/2012 16:10:47] other: Haha you know about beer but not bread :P
[07/07/2012 16:10:56] me: it's so strange? xD
[07/07/2012 16:11:08] other: Well you must have to buy bread? :P
[07/07/2012 16:11:17] me: I don't usually
[07/07/2012 16:11:28] other: I see, I guess you eat better food than toast mostly, haha.
[07/07/2012 16:11:38] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 16:11:40] other: Either way, do you know a cost of a drink like I mentioned above?
[07/07/2012 16:11:42] me: maybe not so good
[07/07/2012 16:11:58] me: nope, but because we don't have mixes like that here
[07/07/2012 16:12:06] other: Ah I see.
[07/07/2012 16:12:17] me: either coke or whiskey but not both together
[07/07/2012 16:12:23] other: OK, what about a bottle of Bacardi rum?
[07/07/2012 16:12:29] me: 20 euros
[07/07/2012 16:12:43] other: What size bottle is that?
[07/07/2012 16:12:50] me: 1.5 L
[07/07/2012 16:12:53] other: (That is $24.)
[07/07/2012 16:12:55] other: WHAT?! :D
[07/07/2012 16:13:03] me: what?
[07/07/2012 16:13:03] other: That's not much more than the US.
[07/07/2012 16:13:06] other: That's crazy.
[07/07/2012 16:13:07] other: Here
[07/07/2012 16:13:12] other: Here it costs WAY more.
[07/07/2012 16:13:19] other: 700ml, so smaller than half that, costs $42.
[07/07/2012 16:13:27] me: we don't have small bottles...
[07/07/2012 16:13:29] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:13:32] other: So $82 for a little less than what you get for $24.
[07/07/2012 16:13:34] me: we're spanish!
[07/07/2012 16:13:35] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:13:37] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 16:13:51] other: What about a case of beer?
[07/07/2012 16:13:59] me: it depends on the beer
[07/07/2012 16:14:07] me: I've ssen them for less than 10 euros
[07/07/2012 16:14:11] me: seen
[07/07/2012 16:14:20] other: For a case or a 6 pack?
[07/07/2012 16:14:27] me: 12
[07/07/2012 16:14:40] other: Here you buy a case of 24, it costs you $50.
[07/07/2012 16:14:43] other: Or more.
[07/07/2012 16:14:44] other: That is the cheapest.
[07/07/2012 16:14:49] me: O.o
[07/07/2012 16:14:56] me: now it's decided
[07/07/2012 16:15:04] me: it's you who has to travel here
[07/07/2012 16:15:05] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:15:10] other: To buy a bottle of beer can cost $6 sometimes if you buy it on its own.
[07/07/2012 16:15:12] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 16:15:21] me: I'll pay as much for your ticket as I have
[07/07/2012 16:15:30] other: Yes, you see? Australia is not so good for some things XD
[07/07/2012 16:15:31] me: but don't make me live without cheap beer please
[07/07/2012 16:15:32] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:15:36] other: Hahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:15:52] other: When it comes time maybe you will help with the cost of my ticket, though I don't know about that yet.
[07/07/2012 16:15:56] other: I do not want to take your money XD
[07/07/2012 16:16:09] me: It's a matter of two
[07/07/2012 16:16:16] me: you want to see me, I want to see you
[07/07/2012 16:16:20] me: it's fair
[07/07/2012 16:16:22] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 16:16:29] other: That is true I suppose.
[07/07/2012 16:16:38] other: We will think about it as it gets a bit closer :)
[07/07/2012 16:16:46] other: Then I will find a way to not go through Dubai, haha.
[07/07/2012 16:16:52] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:17:07] me: If you want me to move my holidays I have to know it kind of soon
[07/07/2012 16:17:13] me: before this month ends
[07/07/2012 16:17:20] other: Hmmmm. When are they meant to be?
[07/07/2012 16:17:25] other: Do you know the dateS?
[07/07/2012 16:17:26] other: dates*
[07/07/2012 16:17:30] me: from 10 to 22 of september
[07/07/2012 16:18:02] other: Hmmm. I think perhaps a little later may be better to give me a little more time first to settle after recent events.
[07/07/2012 16:18:18] me: I can move them to november but not october
[07/07/2012 16:18:26] other: I was thinking perhaps October or November, maybe?
[07/07/2012 16:18:27] me: as I have to assist to a training
[07/07/2012 16:18:29] other: November may be better.
[07/07/2012 16:18:39] other: It would give me plenty of time to settle enough I think.
[07/07/2012 16:18:48] other: I would like it to be sooner but not so soon that I am still a bit fragile.
[07/07/2012 16:18:55] me: and it will make me explode of anxiety
[07/07/2012 16:18:56] other: Which I am a bit still at the moment.
[07/07/2012 16:18:59] me: but it's ok
[07/07/2012 16:19:09] other: What will make you explode of anxiety?
[07/07/2012 16:19:13] me: waiting
[07/07/2012 16:19:14] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:19:17] other: Hahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:19:30] other: I just want to make sure when we meet I am, you know, emotionally healed.
[07/07/2012 16:19:35] other: :)
[07/07/2012 16:19:36] me: :)
[07/07/2012 16:19:44] me: worth the wait then
[07/07/2012 16:19:55] other: What season is it there in November?
[07/07/2012 16:20:06] me: autumn ending
[07/07/2012 16:20:13] other: What are temperatures like?
[07/07/2012 16:20:16] me: not as nice as september but ok
[07/07/2012 16:20:22] me: a little cold
[07/07/2012 16:20:30] me: but you'll be warm I swear
[07/07/2012 16:20:35] other: Do you know roughly in degrees?
[07/07/2012 16:20:38] other: I'm sure it will be fine :)
[07/07/2012 16:20:45] me: not sure...
[07/07/2012 16:20:53] me: these past years weather is crazy
[07/07/2012 16:21:05] me: it could be still hot or a little cold
[07/07/2012 16:21:09] other: Hahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:21:11] me: but not extreme in any way
[07/07/2012 16:21:13] other: It sounds like here this past year.
[07/07/2012 16:21:18] other: I'm sure it will be fine anyway :)
[07/07/2012 16:21:27] me: it will
[07/07/2012 16:21:31] other: I am looking up possible flights just out of interest for that time of year :)
[07/07/2012 16:21:48] me: you don't have to worry about the return flight xD
[07/07/2012 16:22:12] other: Hahaha I do, but I will pay for that :P And it doesn't mean I would take it.
[07/07/2012 16:22:24] other: We could move it etc, or whatever - but there are issues entering countries sometimes.
[07/07/2012 16:22:32] other: The customs people there may need me to prove I have an intent to leave.
[07/07/2012 16:22:44] me: here?
[07/07/2012 16:22:47] me: no here aren't
[07/07/2012 16:22:48] other: You know that I would not be allowed to just stay there forever, yes?
[07/07/2012 16:22:52] other: XD
[07/07/2012 16:23:09] other: The government would not allow that.
[07/07/2012 16:23:41] me: then we could get married xD and problem solved
[07/07/2012 16:23:52] other: Haha yes, I suspect then I could stay :)
[07/07/2012 16:24:10] other: I am looking up the stuff for customs now to see what it says.
[07/07/2012 16:24:20] me: ok
[07/07/2012 16:25:36] other: It looks like around a month or two would not be a problem to stay.
[07/07/2012 16:25:47] me: ^_^
[07/07/2012 16:25:52] other: :)
[07/07/2012 16:26:06] me: that is just awesome
[07/07/2012 16:26:11] me: just having you considering it...
[07/07/2012 16:26:27] me: :')
[07/07/2012 16:26:30] other: Haha, I am thinking about it, planning, etc, just casually :)
[07/07/2012 16:26:37] other: It will get more serious as it gets closer.
[07/07/2012 16:26:54] me: You can keep the whole desk for you!
[07/07/2012 16:27:08] me: that's how serious I am, I give you my little temple
[07/07/2012 16:27:11] me: :)
[07/07/2012 16:27:13] other: I notice that the flight can go through the UK father than Dubai, although it stops in Singapore but I think that is OK...
[07/07/2012 16:27:15] other: Haha :D
[07/07/2012 16:27:23] other: I would share your desk, not take it over. <3
[07/07/2012 16:27:40] me: then none of us will get the work done xD
[07/07/2012 16:27:52] other: I had considered stopping in the UK briefly to visit a friend there - I will look into that as well.
[07/07/2012 16:28:06] me: ok, it's a good idea
[07/07/2012 16:28:09] other: A female friend, if you are wondering ;)
[07/07/2012 16:28:19] other: She is the one I mentioned in my interview with Lou, who I taught to code.
[07/07/2012 16:28:25] me: ^_^
[07/07/2012 16:28:29] other: I wouldn't mind seeing her for a few days on my way to see you :)
[07/07/2012 16:28:30] me: is she lesbian?
[07/07/2012 16:28:31] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:28:36] other: Hahaha, no, she is not :)
[07/07/2012 16:28:42] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 16:28:45] me: ok
[07/07/2012 16:28:51] other: My family is from the UK, I mean my mother is - and so it would be nice to visit if only for that reason.
[07/07/2012 16:29:03] other: But she would just love to meet me I am sure and I would like to meet her too.
[07/07/2012 16:29:05] me: ^_^ I've been there
[07/07/2012 16:29:11] me: it's beautiful
[07/07/2012 16:29:14] me: but always raining
[07/07/2012 16:29:15] other: It would also end up being slightly cheaper on the ticket price.
[07/07/2012 16:29:17] other: Haha :D
[07/07/2012 16:29:24] other: I know it is a cold place to go.
[07/07/2012 16:29:46] other: I will think on this further :) We will talk more on it as it gets closer.
[07/07/2012 16:30:01] other: But yes, I think November is a good time. It is not too soon.
[07/07/2012 16:30:01] me: ok, I'll try to move my holidays this next week
[07/07/2012 16:30:24] other: Only if that is OK by you, I don't want you to feel bad about it or get stuck working too much and no break soon because of me.
[07/07/2012 16:30:27] other: I would feel far too bad.
[07/07/2012 16:30:39] me: HA!
[07/07/2012 16:31:07] me: I have the possibility of having you here and you want me to be working all day?
[07/07/2012 16:31:10] me: no no no
[07/07/2012 16:31:14] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:31:18] other: Hahahaha
[07/07/2012 16:31:24] other: No, but I work plenty too ^-^;
[07/07/2012 16:31:28] other: I would slack off a lot there
[07/07/2012 16:31:32] other: but you know what I mean.
[07/07/2012 16:31:38] other: BUT, speaking of work - I must go do more.
[07/07/2012 16:31:42] me: yeah I know
[07/07/2012 16:31:44] me: ooook
[07/07/2012 16:31:45] other: Not done yet ^-^;
[07/07/2012 16:31:50] me: sorry :P
[07/07/2012 16:31:53] other: I will go for cig, go back to forum and finish soon I hope.
[07/07/2012 16:32:03] other: But this was a nice chat and we will chat again in a bit :)
[07/07/2012 16:32:05] other: I should be up for awhile yet.
[07/07/2012 16:32:11] me: oook
[07/07/2012 16:32:24] me: I'll wait ;) maybe not much but I will
[07/07/2012 16:32:25] me: xD
[07/07/2012 16:32:32] other: Hahaha, good.
[07/07/2012 16:32:37] me: :*
[07/07/2012 16:32:41] other: Talk again shortly, off for cig then more work XD :*
[07/07/2012 17:18:22] me:  if (dragMoai) then
  local x, y = moaiP:getLoc()
  local offset = mouseX - x
 
  if (mouseX > - 160 + 32 and mouseX < 160 - 32) then
   moaiP:moveLoc(offset, 0, 0)
  end
 end
[07/07/2012 17:18:24] me: oops
[07/07/2012 17:18:26] me: sorry!

[07/07/2012 17:27:22] other: One sec, haha, on a call :)
[07/07/2012 17:27:56] me: I didn't wanted to interrupt (worry)
[07/07/2012 17:29:27] other: That's fine, I'll be back shortly
[07/07/2012 17:29:29] other: :)
[07/07/2012 17:48:45] me: I'm going for a super quick shower
[07/07/2012 17:48:51] me: (getting very hot here)
[07/07/2012 17:49:07] other: Cool still on phone but back soon :)

[07/07/2012 18:00:45] other: Sorry about that - that was Cleo, my friend in the UK, first time we've gotten to speak since right before I left Sydney.
[07/07/2012 18:00:50] other: So almost a month.
[07/07/2012 18:00:53] me: :)
[07/07/2012 18:01:03] me: she is your best friend right?
[07/07/2012 18:01:05] other: But yes, I am back now, though I haven't quite finished work so may be a tad slow XD
[07/07/2012 18:01:15] other: She is one of my best friends :)
[07/07/2012 18:01:31] other: I don't have just one best friend :) I have a few I am very close to.
[07/07/2012 18:01:47] me: hahaha yeah I forgot how popular you are for a sec
[07/07/2012 18:01:49] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:01:56] other: Hahaha :D
[07/07/2012 18:02:01] other: I am a bit popular, yes :)
[07/07/2012 18:02:10] me: I'm having trouble with moai threads!
[07/07/2012 18:02:15] me: >_<
[07/07/2012 18:02:33] other: Threads as in forum threads, or as in, you know ... the other kind :D
[07/07/2012 18:02:42] other: (I don't know how to talk about some tech things, lol.)
[07/07/2012 18:02:43] me: the code ones
[07/07/2012 18:02:55] other: Oh I see.
[07/07/2012 18:03:04] me: aka as a processing sequence
[07/07/2012 18:03:06] other: Yes, I found that confusing also. It is, yes, confusing.
[07/07/2012 18:03:24] me: I understand them as I've played with similar things in Java
[07/07/2012 18:03:50] me: but how to perform a single thread for many props instead of just one...
[07/07/2012 18:03:57] me: or maybe... how to pack props on a layer
[07/07/2012 18:04:07] me: either one of those would be the solution
[07/07/2012 18:04:11] me: argh!
[07/07/2012 18:04:18] other: I am afraid I am not yet at a point I have any insight on that.
[07/07/2012 18:04:19] me: I need a cig
[07/07/2012 18:04:20] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:04:36] other: I wanted to work on Moai today but wont get to >.<' I haven't got my report done yet. Probably 20 odd minutes off finishing.
[07/07/2012 18:04:42] other: And already it is 1:34am.
[07/07/2012 18:04:46] other: >.<'
[07/07/2012 18:05:27] other: Sorry ^-^; I am not so helpful.
[07/07/2012 18:05:52] me: haha I'll figure it out
[07/07/2012 18:05:57] me: sooner or later
[07/07/2012 18:06:01] me: but I know I will
[07/07/2012 18:06:05] *** me envi MoaiTestings.zip ***
[07/07/2012 18:06:11] me: this is what I have until now
[07/07/2012 18:06:30] me: put your own run.sh I don't use the same path as you
[07/07/2012 18:06:38] other: one sec :)
[07/07/2012 18:07:24] me: you can drag the moai
[07/07/2012 18:07:25] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:07:30] me: it has to shoot
[07/07/2012 18:07:40] me: and the corona's have to go down slowly
[07/07/2012 18:07:40] other: Having trouble finding my thing, sorry, one tic XD
[07/07/2012 18:07:52] me: your thing? XD
[07/07/2012 18:08:13] other: Hah, my moai stuff. I had a Moai thing on the desktop, moved now apparently.
[07/07/2012 18:09:02] other: There we go, running it now :)
[07/07/2012 18:09:06] me: of course the moai bullets will be peaches
[07/07/2012 18:09:10] me: :D
[07/07/2012 18:09:16] other: HAHAHAHA
[07/07/2012 18:09:22] other: That is fabulous!
[07/07/2012 18:09:32] other: I haven't looked at code yet but it's awesome :D
[07/07/2012 18:09:55] me: this could be the right template to show walter
[07/07/2012 18:09:58] me: oops
[07/07/2012 18:09:59] me: w
[07/07/2012 18:10:00] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:10:05] other: Oh, just FYI, you have one typo ;)
[07/07/2012 18:10:16] other: Heh, yes it very well could be :D
[07/07/2012 18:10:19] me: where?
[07/07/2012 18:10:21] other: Line 487
[07/07/2012 18:10:35] me: that's not a typo smart ass
[07/07/2012 18:10:37] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:10:39] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 18:10:41] other: It's not? :P
[07/07/2012 18:10:50] me: it's my own print function
[07/07/2012 18:10:57] other: Oh I see, haha :D
[07/07/2012 18:10:58] other: Sorry!
[07/07/2012 18:11:02] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 18:11:22] other: Wait I get an error though XD
[07/07/2012 18:11:26] other: In terminal.
[07/07/2012 18:11:31] other: Do you?
[07/07/2012 18:11:37] me: nope
[07/07/2012 18:11:57] other: How odd. I must have done something somehow XD
[07/07/2012 18:12:01] other: I don't know how lol
[07/07/2012 18:12:08] me: oh true
[07/07/2012 18:12:11] me: line 61
[07/07/2012 18:12:18] other: Yes ^-^;
[07/07/2012 18:12:20] other: Good, I didn't break it :P
[07/07/2012 18:12:30] me: gosh
[07/07/2012 18:12:36] other: It is still awesome :)
[07/07/2012 18:12:45] me: put the printt function before the checkMen function
[07/07/2012 18:13:22] me: interpreted languages always fuck me for making my own sortings
[07/07/2012 18:13:34] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 18:13:51] other: Much better :)
[07/07/2012 18:13:53] other: No error now.
[07/07/2012 18:13:57] me: yeah, bug-free
[07/07/2012 18:14:04] me: but still not much fun
[07/07/2012 18:14:10] other: But still awesome I think :D
[07/07/2012 18:14:35] me: to be true, I still don't know a shit about Moai
[07/07/2012 18:14:43] me: but lua is lua
[07/07/2012 18:15:32] other: I suppose that is true.
[07/07/2012 18:15:39] me: so don't be scared
[07/07/2012 18:15:51] me: you'll get into it fast as a shark
[07/07/2012 18:16:00] other: I hope so XD It is not easy for me.
[07/07/2012 18:16:10] other: I like this a lot though, it is very cool :)
[07/07/2012 18:16:19] other: The idea behind it is wicked.
[07/07/2012 18:16:24] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 18:16:38] me: have you seen what country is in the middle?
[07/07/2012 18:16:39] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:16:56] me: a moai defense force from spain!
[07/07/2012 18:16:58] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:18:01] other: XD
[07/07/2012 18:18:10] other: Spain seems better by the day :D
[07/07/2012 18:18:26] me: but I must have a rest now, drink my cheap beer and think about solving the threads
[07/07/2012 18:18:39] me: as you can see, it is not coded straightforward+
[07/07/2012 18:18:47] other: I think that makes sense LD
[07/07/2012 18:18:50] me: it's coded in a way it can be used for MANY projects
[07/07/2012 18:18:52] other: It is not straightforward at all.
[07/07/2012 18:18:58] other: But you have done very well.
[07/07/2012 18:19:03] other: And together we will learn more and more :)
[07/07/2012 18:19:20] other: (I mentioned to Carlos you were poking at Moai this weekend a bit, and I think you and me can help each other with it.) :)
[07/07/2012 18:19:32] me: oh
[07/07/2012 18:19:36] me: what did he said?
[07/07/2012 18:19:45] other: He said it was good :)
[07/07/2012 18:19:55] other: I think he is happy you are looking at it also.
[07/07/2012 18:20:10] me: he knows if I do it it will be for your good
[07/07/2012 18:20:25] other: Haha, do you think so? :)
[07/07/2012 18:20:35] me: :) I think he knows well how I feel about you
[07/07/2012 18:20:55] other: Do you? :)
[07/07/2012 18:21:02] me: yeah
[07/07/2012 18:21:14] other: Why do you think that?
[07/07/2012 18:21:24] me: again with the questions?
[07/07/2012 18:21:25] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:21:32] other: Yes :P
[07/07/2012 18:21:38] me: I'll tell you on november
[07/07/2012 18:21:52] other: Hahaha, I know clearly you told him something about me :P
[07/07/2012 18:21:55] other: I'm just curious what it was.
[07/07/2012 18:22:26] me: you'll have to carry the curiosity for a while
[07/07/2012 18:22:29] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 18:22:39] other: XD That isn't very fair.
[07/07/2012 18:22:47] other: I like to know what people say about me :)
[07/07/2012 18:23:02] other: If I was talking to someone about you wouldn't you want to know what I said? :P
[07/07/2012 18:23:26] me: hmmm
[07/07/2012 18:23:42] me: knowing it's not bad I could have enough
[07/07/2012 18:23:46] me: :D
[07/07/2012 18:23:53] other: XD
[07/07/2012 18:24:00] other: I still want to know.
[07/07/2012 18:24:06] other: I left you alone about the makeup thing mostly :P
[07/07/2012 18:24:20] me: this could be for the same reason
[07/07/2012 18:24:26] me: so it's only one matter
[07/07/2012 18:24:53] other: I'm just interested if Carlos knows you like me how you do XD That's all.
[07/07/2012 18:25:07] me: I think yes
[07/07/2012 18:25:16] me: 90% sure
[07/07/2012 18:25:25] other: He is a mutual friend so I like to know what he knows about you and I, just because it's odd otherwise ^-^;
[07/07/2012 18:26:17] me: i think he clearly know I love you but he doesn't expect me to be as crazy as to throw it all to be with you...
[07/07/2012 18:26:52] me: in a way when I talk with him he seems to see me as a crazy nerd that won't get any far
[07/07/2012 18:27:06] me: and that's ok, the farest I want to go is to your arms...
[07/07/2012 18:27:09] me: :D
[07/07/2012 18:27:41] other: He thinks you wont get far with what? With apps or with me?
[07/07/2012 18:27:43] other: XD
[07/07/2012 18:27:48] me: maybe both xD
[07/07/2012 18:28:02] me: but he doesn't know me much
[07/07/2012 18:28:07] other: Hah, why do you think he thinks that? Maybe he thinks I am not worth the time :D
[07/07/2012 18:28:29] me: no, but he probably knows half the world is after you
[07/07/2012 18:28:41] me: while the other half are gay
[07/07/2012 18:28:49] other: Hahaha
[07/07/2012 18:28:51] other: :D
[07/07/2012 18:29:14] other: I think he probably just thinks I am not that appealing, too ordinary, so you will lose interest or something.
[07/07/2012 18:29:20] me: so I think he sees me as the poor guy that will have his heart broken
[07/07/2012 18:29:37] other: I hope he doesn't think I will break your heart XD
[07/07/2012 18:29:51] other: Though I think he is a cynic, so he just thinks it would fail. I do not know.
[07/07/2012 18:30:18] me: I dont really mind
[07/07/2012 18:30:23] me: have you seen my code?
[07/07/2012 18:30:32] me: I'm using the _parameter more than ever
[07/07/2012 18:30:38] me: just to piss him off
[07/07/2012 18:30:38] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:31:12] other: Hahahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 18:31:21] other: I am glancing at it now, yes.
[07/07/2012 18:31:24] other: Very amusing.
[07/07/2012 18:31:31] me: when it's finished I'll send it to him
[07/07/2012 18:31:40] me: so probably will run it and say it's nice
[07/07/2012 18:31:45] me: and then he'll check the code
[07/07/2012 18:31:45] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:32:51] me: but I think a Moai that throws Peaches at Corona is a great metaphor
[07/07/2012 18:33:04] me: I want to have it finished tomorrow if I can
[07/07/2012 18:33:07] other: Hahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 18:33:18] other: I think it is a great metaphor too.
[07/07/2012 18:33:21] other: It is very clever.
[07/07/2012 18:33:45] me: how do you think it would have to shoot?
[07/07/2012 18:33:49] me: automatically?
[07/07/2012 18:33:56] me: or maybe some crazy touchy thing?
[07/07/2012 18:34:15] other: I don't know, good question.
[07/07/2012 18:34:17] other: (worry)
[07/07/2012 18:34:43] me: quick! or the invaders will cover the earth
[07/07/2012 18:34:47] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:34:50] other: Lol :D
[07/07/2012 18:35:06] other: Maybe a button? I don't know.
[07/07/2012 18:35:10] other: Or a tap.
[07/07/2012 18:35:11] other: Anywhere.
[07/07/2012 18:35:12] other: Maybe.
[07/07/2012 18:35:25] me: so drag moai and then tap anywhere...
[07/07/2012 18:35:35] me: I'll try it
[07/07/2012 18:35:41] me: I don't like buttons
[07/07/2012 18:35:43] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:36:23] me: they are always there, watching you, never move a bit... shit they're scary
[07/07/2012 18:36:27] other: I think it would be fairly intuitive that way, probably.
[07/07/2012 18:36:32] other: Hahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 18:37:04] other: You still haven't told me what you said to Carlos to let him know you liked me :P
[07/07/2012 18:37:27] me: ...
[07/07/2012 18:37:35] other: XD
[07/07/2012 18:37:45] other: You like avoiding telling me things :P
[07/07/2012 18:37:46] other: Don't you?
[07/07/2012 18:37:53] me: I'm going out for a cig
[07/07/2012 18:37:56] other: It is your hobby, haha :D
[07/07/2012 18:37:56] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:38:05] other: Are you actually going out for a cig? XD
[07/07/2012 18:38:19] me: naah
[07/07/2012 18:38:27] other: I wasn't sure ^-^;
[07/07/2012 18:38:32] me: but I didn't wanted to mention that yet
[07/07/2012 18:38:42] me: it slipped out of my mouth...
[07/07/2012 18:38:49] me: and I can't tell you yet
[07/07/2012 18:38:51] other: Do you have a real reason or are you just not wanting to tell me? ^-^;
[07/07/2012 18:39:15] me: I have a good real reason that I think you'll like when the time comes
[07/07/2012 18:39:27] other: Very well, that is OK then.
[07/07/2012 18:39:29] other: I don't mind when you have a real reason :)
[07/07/2012 18:39:58] me: I can bother you sometimes in a funny way
[07/07/2012 18:40:02] me: but not so much
[07/07/2012 18:40:20] me: this is not for making you more and more curious, ok?
[07/07/2012 18:40:29] other: Yeah, that is OK when it is like that.
[07/07/2012 18:40:30] other: :)
[07/07/2012 18:40:40] me: phew...
[07/07/2012 18:40:43] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 18:40:44] other: Can I ask what Carlos said when you let him know you liked me, or is that also a secret right now?
[07/07/2012 18:40:51] other: You know I don't push if it's a *real* reason :P
[07/07/2012 18:40:55] me: oh no secret
[07/07/2012 18:41:02] me: he said this:
[07/07/2012 18:41:05] me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[07/07/2012 18:41:16] me: maybe I missed a few HA's
[07/07/2012 18:41:20] me: but that was it
[07/07/2012 18:41:20] other: Really? XD
[07/07/2012 18:41:28] other: Nothing else? Just laughed? XD
[07/07/2012 18:41:38] me: yeah
[07/07/2012 18:41:45] me: is that bad?
[07/07/2012 18:41:46] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:41:48] other: Wow. That is... odd.
[07/07/2012 18:41:49] other: XD
[07/07/2012 18:41:52] me: why?
[07/07/2012 18:42:09] other: Well, hah, if you told him something to let him know you liked me and he laughed it seems strange XD
[07/07/2012 18:42:16] other: It isn't good or bad, just funny/odd.
[07/07/2012 18:42:34] other: I mean I find it strange to laugh XD I wouldn't think it was funny.
[07/07/2012 18:42:40] other: But that's not bad - it's just interesting :)
[07/07/2012 18:42:51] me: don't worry I'll ask for his approval before asking you something serious xD
[07/07/2012 18:43:00] me: and he better give it to me!
[07/07/2012 18:43:08] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 18:43:16] other: He is somewhat like my guardian in many ways
[07/07/2012 18:43:21] other: So if you are good I am sure he will
[07/07/2012 18:43:25] other: Unless you want to sell me to W.
[07/07/2012 18:43:30] other: Then he will say no :P
[07/07/2012 18:43:39] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 18:43:55] me: there's only one thing I want for w
[07/07/2012 18:44:02] me: the template I'm making
[07/07/2012 18:44:05] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:44:18] other: Hahahaha :D
[07/07/2012 18:44:39] me: do you have a photo of carlos laughing?
[07/07/2012 18:44:47] me: I would like to put it on the ending scene
[07/07/2012 18:44:48] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:45:10] other: Hahahaha I am not sure. I feel like I had one somewhere that looked a bit like a laugh... hold on let me look.
[07/07/2012 18:45:17] me: ok
[07/07/2012 18:46:05] other: No, it's super blurry and just a big smile I am afraid.
[07/07/2012 18:46:07] other: Sorry!
[07/07/2012 18:46:46] me: ok
[07/07/2012 18:46:58] me: I'll make some photoshop with a clown smile or something then
[07/07/2012 18:46:58] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:47:41] other: Haha, that is a good idea.
[07/07/2012 18:47:46] me: Todd just answered my email complaining about the interview
[07/07/2012 18:47:51] me: :D
[07/07/2012 18:47:58] other: What did he say? I hope you were polite!
[07/07/2012 18:48:15] me: I wasn't, I told him it was a shitty interview
[07/07/2012 18:48:16] me: xD
[07/07/2012 18:49:02] other: Hahaha XD
[07/07/2012 18:49:23] me: let me answer back and forward the 3 messages to you ;)
[07/07/2012 18:49:29] other: OK :)
[07/07/2012 19:02:11] me: i'm sorry
[07/07/2012 19:02:16] me: i'm thinking
[07/07/2012 19:02:20] other: Hmmm?
[07/07/2012 19:02:31] other: That's OK, I had to send report anyway just now :)
[07/07/2012 19:02:32] me: I don't know how to catch him
[07/07/2012 19:02:41] other: I will go for a cig in a moment too so you have time.
[07/07/2012 19:02:48] me: can't you help me?
[07/07/2012 19:02:50] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:02:53] other: Or if you want to send to me now I don't mind looking and trying to sugge
[07/07/2012 19:02:55] me: pleeeeeeease
[07/07/2012 19:03:01] other: That ^ I just typed as you typed your thing.
[07/07/2012 19:03:06] other: I was offering to try and help :)
[07/07/2012 19:03:15] other: If you send it to me I will take a look and see if I have any thoughts.
[07/07/2012 19:04:26] me: it has what I've written so far too
[07/07/2012 19:04:37] me: but not the attachment to not get it slow
[07/07/2012 19:04:39] other: Uhmmmmmm my mother and vic are....
[07/07/2012 19:04:50] other: I am going out for a cig or two.
[07/07/2012 19:04:54] me: are you jealous?
[07/07/2012 19:04:57] other: To not hear their sex >.<'
[07/07/2012 19:04:58] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:05:02] other: It's creepy.
[07/07/2012 19:05:09] me: we can do it louder
[07/07/2012 19:05:12] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:05:13] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 19:05:22] other: Either way I can't listen to them doing that XD Too creepy!
[07/07/2012 19:05:26] me: :*
[07/07/2012 19:05:27] other: Back in a couple minutes, OK?
[07/07/2012 19:05:29] other: :*
[07/07/2012 19:05:29] me: ok
[07/07/2012 19:10:18] other: Back
[07/07/2012 19:10:26] me: so fast?
[07/07/2012 19:10:29] me: poor vic
[07/07/2012 19:10:29] other: Though I should sleep soon, but yes, did you forward to me?
[07/07/2012 19:10:36] other: Haha I think they stopped, I hope so.
[07/07/2012 19:10:41] other: I just went for one cig.
[07/07/2012 19:10:41] me: yeah
[07/07/2012 19:10:48] me: I sent you the whole thing
[07/07/2012 19:10:49] other: They may have been doing it awhile and got louder at the end :D
[07/07/2012 19:11:00] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 19:11:04] me: nicely done then
[07/07/2012 19:11:07] other: OK, one tic, let me just finish this quick email I was writing to a user - almost done, it got interrupted XD
[07/07/2012 19:11:09] me: 1 point for mum
[07/07/2012 19:11:13] other: Lol
[07/07/2012 19:13:11] other: OK, reading now.
[07/07/2012 19:13:27] me: I know I sound a little dummy there
[07/07/2012 19:13:33] me: but that's my role ;)
[07/07/2012 19:13:40] me: innocent little dev
[07/07/2012 19:14:05] other: Yours is going to be a response you haven't sent yet, the top one, yes?
[07/07/2012 19:14:11] me: yes
[07/07/2012 19:14:11] other: (Just making sure I know what I'm reading :))
[07/07/2012 19:14:16] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 19:14:17] other: OK, one minute while I read then :)
[07/07/2012 19:14:22] me: ok
[07/07/2012 19:16:38] other: Almost done, it is a bit to read ;)
[07/07/2012 19:16:48] me: I know, :)
[07/07/2012 19:21:18] other: I think what you have is good, the thing to add would be before the last line, after that paragraph, just try to say something like; "I am not saying that you should aim Moai at all newbie developers, but that by focussing on trying to make it slightly more accessible you could gain many users from Corona who are seeking an alternative and while not all will stick around many will, you have nothing to lose and so many potential users to gain who, like me, have shipped only one or two apps and will be capable of using Moai but could just use a little extra support"
[07/07/2012 19:21:22] other: Something like that, though in your own words.
[07/07/2012 19:21:49] me: that's why you are the best
[07/07/2012 19:21:53] me: :*
[07/07/2012 19:22:17] me: even sleepy and hearing some fucking you are brilliant :D
[07/07/2012 19:22:32] other: Try to make it clear that it isn't about *competition* but about *choices*, users having somewhere to go, etc. (I don't think Todd likes the competitive side so you have to make it gentler like that, I think.)
[07/07/2012 19:22:36] other: Haha :) Thank you.
[07/07/2012 19:22:49] other: I don't know how his response will be but that, I think, is best way to handle it.
[07/07/2012 19:23:17] me: so far I like how he talks
[07/07/2012 19:23:24] me: but he is to tied to the business
[07/07/2012 19:23:27] me: too
[07/07/2012 19:23:34] other: Yes, I know. He certainly is.
[07/07/2012 19:23:45] other: By the way I liked your paragraph from first email;
I care a lot about Peach... and she talks a lot about learning Moai and getting ready for something that could happen but thinking about her... in a way, now she is the heroe of newbies but if she finally gets into Moai and leave Corona, I think she would be lost, and taking in account her GREAT following, that would be a loss that isn't really needed.
[07/07/2012 19:23:51] other: That was good and also nice, thank you :)
[07/07/2012 19:23:57] me: :)
[07/07/2012 19:24:11] me: there are some lost pieces like that scattered around the world...
[07/07/2012 19:24:37] me: but don't think that is totally sincere
[07/07/2012 19:24:45] me: I don't think you'd be lost
[07/07/2012 19:24:52] me: I just wanted to add some pressure
[07/07/2012 19:25:02] other: When I was outside having my cig I thought a little more about Carlos laughing at you when you said whatever you said to let him know you liked me - and I thought when I visit you we should take a picture and send it to him :D Just to show him not to be so fast to laugh.
[07/07/2012 19:25:13] other: I appreciate that - I think I would be a bit lost.
[07/07/2012 19:25:22] other: Not totally but a bit, I wouldn't be as useful, that is for sure.
[07/07/2012 19:25:41] me: you won't
[07/07/2012 19:25:58] me: I think the first we have to figure out is how to make a full app
[07/07/2012 19:26:09] me: not using everything on the phone
[07/07/2012 19:26:14] me: but from the start to the end
[07/07/2012 19:26:24] me: that's what I'm making this as a template
[07/07/2012 19:26:31] me: gosh! ... why
[07/07/2012 19:26:46] me: so we have a way to simply fill the voids
[07/07/2012 19:26:46] other: Hmmm?
[07/07/2012 19:26:52] other: Ah sorry
[07/07/2012 19:26:57] other: Got it, it was a typo :D
[07/07/2012 19:27:01] me: yeah
[07/07/2012 19:27:06] other: I think yes, you are right.
[07/07/2012 19:27:06] me: I'm making too many
[07/07/2012 19:27:15] other: No, it was a simple one, I am just sleepy.
[07/07/2012 19:27:35] me: :)
[07/07/2012 19:27:49] other: Did you like my picture suggestion? ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:28:03] me: hehe
[07/07/2012 19:28:08] me: LOVE IT
[07/07/2012 19:28:13] other: Hah, good :D
[07/07/2012 19:28:15] me: but was astonished at it
[07/07/2012 19:28:20] me: sorry
[07/07/2012 19:28:29] me: you impress me some times and I have to recover
[07/07/2012 19:28:30] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:28:33] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 19:28:47] other: Don't mention to him I am planning to visit sometime, if you haven't already?
[07/07/2012 19:28:50] other: If you have that is OK.
[07/07/2012 19:28:53] me: ok
[07/07/2012 19:29:02] me: I mentioned I was planning to visit
[07/07/2012 19:29:03] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:29:05] me: not you
[07/07/2012 19:29:09] other: That's OK :)
[07/07/2012 19:29:20] other: I just wondered. We just wont mention it to him again for now unless it comes up.
[07/07/2012 19:29:21] me: now he'll think I crapped
[07/07/2012 19:29:28] other: If it does it doesn't matter but yeah, hah.
[07/07/2012 19:29:33] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:29:34] other: He would be surprised then to see a photo.
[07/07/2012 19:29:45] other: What did he say when you said you were planning to visit? XD
[07/07/2012 19:29:58] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:30:15] me: that time he didn't talked about you
[07/07/2012 19:30:34] me: he told me I must go have a coffee with Jayant if I go to Australia
[07/07/2012 19:30:41] other: HAH XD
[07/07/2012 19:30:46] me: I replied with: Y UN HUEVO!
[07/07/2012 19:30:52] me: very latin ;)
[07/07/2012 19:30:54] other: Did you tell him you planned on visiting me, or that you planned on visiting Australia?
[07/07/2012 19:30:59] other: What does that mean? :P
[07/07/2012 19:31:01] other: :)*
[07/07/2012 19:31:15] me: literally it means 'and an egg'
[07/07/2012 19:31:17] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:31:25] me: so it doesn't make any sense
[07/07/2012 19:31:48] me: but it's like saying 'not even in your best dreams fool'
[07/07/2012 19:31:59] other: Haha, very good then.
[07/07/2012 19:32:06] me: I told him I planned to visit you!
[07/07/2012 19:32:15] me: I don't really mind where
[07/07/2012 19:32:24] other: Heh, that's cool, just wondered. ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:32:30] other: I am surprised he didn't comment, maybe he thinks it is just a dream.
[07/07/2012 19:32:32] other: :D
[07/07/2012 19:32:47] me: that's why I think he thinks I won't get far xD
[07/07/2012 19:33:00] other: Hah
[07/07/2012 19:33:18] other: That and the "HAHAHAHAHA" - which you can't tell me what he was laughing at exactly, right?
[07/07/2012 19:33:37] me: yeah...
[07/07/2012 19:33:52] other: Well yes, I see what you would think that then, that he thinks you wont get far XD
[07/07/2012 19:33:57] me: woah you are very hard to manage with that xD
[07/07/2012 19:34:20] other: You mean mentioning that you couldn't tell me something? ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:34:20] me: could you forget eventually?
[07/07/2012 19:34:25] other: Hah!
[07/07/2012 19:34:27] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:34:30] other: I will always be curious about these things.
[07/07/2012 19:34:36] other: But I wasn't trying to get you to tell me then.
[07/07/2012 19:34:39] me: ok ok
[07/07/2012 19:34:49] other: I was just talking about understanding why you would think he thought that.
[07/07/2012 19:35:03] other: I do want to know when you feel like it is OK to tell me, but you know that anyway :D
[07/07/2012 19:35:10] me: but I don't think he does that because he thinks i'm not good for you :P
[07/07/2012 19:35:17] other: I don't pester when I know you have a good reason :)
[07/07/2012 19:35:18] me: but because there are so many after you
[07/07/2012 19:35:26] other: Haha why would he think you are not good for me?
[07/07/2012 19:35:35] me: cos he's latin too
[07/07/2012 19:35:36] other: Oh wait I misread I think.
[07/07/2012 19:35:37] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:36:00] other: What is wrong with being latin? XD
[07/07/2012 19:36:06] me: hahahaha
[07/07/2012 19:36:21] me: I don't know, but we have bad 'fame'
[07/07/2012 19:36:33] other: Also, for the record, I don't think Carlos knows that many people are after me :D
[07/07/2012 19:36:55] me: although as a good nerd, I'm not like most of society
[07/07/2012 19:37:02] me: don't you think so?
[07/07/2012 19:37:12] me: If they were many crushes at the office...
[07/07/2012 19:37:15] me: I really think he does
[07/07/2012 19:37:34] other: Haha, Gilbert thought I was cute but he was like that with many girls I think.
[07/07/2012 19:37:48] other: Eric from office fancies me a lot, but Carlos thinks that was just because I was a girl and I was there.
[07/07/2012 19:38:13] me: you make it sound like desperate calls for women...
[07/07/2012 19:38:42] other: Carlos though Eric was desperate I think.
[07/07/2012 19:38:45] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:38:48] other: When Eric clearly liked me a lot.
[07/07/2012 19:38:48] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:38:54] other: That is why I think he would be surprised, honestly.
[07/07/2012 19:39:02] other: I think he finds the idea of someone liking me like that odd XD
[07/07/2012 19:39:09] me: in a way I'm desperate for you too
[07/07/2012 19:39:13] me: but just for you!
[07/07/2012 19:39:23] other: Maybe because I do not look like all his girly, makeup wearing, model ex girlfriends :D
[07/07/2012 19:39:26] other: Haha, thank you <3
[07/07/2012 19:39:42] me: I work surrounded by girls and women
[07/07/2012 19:39:58] me: the typical administrative empty headed ones
[07/07/2012 19:40:02] other: Haha :D
[07/07/2012 19:40:05] me: I hate women
[07/07/2012 19:40:07] me: xD

[07/07/2012 19:40:42] other: Te amo.... something.
[07/07/2012 19:40:49] other: How do I say "I love you too"?
[07/07/2012 19:41:00] me: yo tambin te amo
[07/07/2012 19:41:05] other: Oh god, lol.
[07/07/2012 19:41:08] other: Way harder than "te amo"
[07/07/2012 19:41:11] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:41:21] me: I too love you
[07/07/2012 19:41:23] me: inverse
[07/07/2012 19:41:27] other: Yo tambin te amo.

[07/07/2012 19:41:46] other: No :P
[07/07/2012 19:41:48] other: I wish.
[07/07/2012 19:41:53] other: I realized I can do it in Skype in Lion.
[07/07/2012 19:41:59] me: hahahahaha
[07/07/2012 19:42:04] other: Hold down a key and it will give option of special character.
[07/07/2012 19:42:09] me: yeah I know
[07/07/2012 19:42:11] me: cool
[07/07/2012 19:42:15] other: It does it in Safari too but I use Firefox which it doesn't do it in!
[07/07/2012 19:42:24] other: Did you know that? About not doing it in Firefox?
[07/07/2012 19:42:27] other: That is a pain.
[07/07/2012 19:42:35] me: I don't use firefox
[07/07/2012 19:42:43] me: safari on mac and chrome on windows
[07/07/2012 19:42:58] me: when I develop html5 apps, opera
[07/07/2012 19:43:03] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 19:43:05] other: Too many :P
[07/07/2012 19:43:14] other: I use Firefox. Safari too, but less.
[07/07/2012 19:43:31] me: each one has its little things :)
[07/07/2012 19:43:39] other: True.
[07/07/2012 19:43:48] other: I joke that Chrome is my "porn browser" XD
[07/07/2012 19:43:52] me: opera is way cooler to debug apps
[07/07/2012 19:43:57] other: I don't actually look at porn lately, just so you know XD
[07/07/2012 19:44:03] other: But it used to be the one I used for that.
[07/07/2012 19:44:03] me: why not?
[07/07/2012 19:44:16] other: I don't know, I'm not that interested.
[07/07/2012 19:44:23] me: gosh
[07/07/2012 19:44:26] other: I do read some fanfic stuff though XD
[07/07/2012 19:44:34] other: Which is a very nerdy thing to do :D
[07/07/2012 19:44:41] me: hahaha yeah
[07/07/2012 19:44:52] other: By that I mean erotic fanfic, just to be clear :D
[07/07/2012 19:44:58] other: Not just ordinary fanfic XD
[07/07/2012 19:45:11] me: well I have my times with porn... I not going to lie
[07/07/2012 19:45:32] me: maybe not as much as it could seem xD
[07/07/2012 19:45:37] other: That is fair enough :D
[07/07/2012 19:45:56] other: If you are single porn is OK, in a relationship it is OK if the other person is OK with it. (That is what I think.)
[07/07/2012 19:46:07] other: It's only if it bothers someone, or is secret, or whatever, then it is bad.
[07/07/2012 19:46:07] me: same
[07/07/2012 19:46:20] me: the only thing that's bad is to lie
[07/07/2012 19:46:25] me: and hide things is lying
[07/07/2012 19:46:25] other: Or when people watch it but then don't have sex with each other, which is just sad XD
[07/07/2012 19:46:38] other: Yes, that is called "omission"
[07/07/2012 19:46:57] other: Hiding something on purpose, that is what "omission" means.
[07/07/2012 19:46:58] other: :)
[07/07/2012 19:47:06] me: if i'm totally transparent with you I hope you'll understand me well :)
[07/07/2012 19:47:20] me: and well get to love each other even more
[07/07/2012 19:47:37] other: I am glad you try to be totally transparent, I try to do that too :)
[07/07/2012 19:48:01] me: not many girls recon watching porn you know...
[07/07/2012 19:48:02] other: Being honest is good to build a relationship on, any relationship, friendship, romantic, professional, etc :)
[07/07/2012 19:48:09] other: I know.
[07/07/2012 19:48:14] other: Most girls don't like porn.
[07/07/2012 19:48:25] other: I have specific tastes though XD
[07/07/2012 19:48:30] me: hahahah
[07/07/2012 19:48:35] other: I do prefer reading certain fanfic stuff over porn though.
[07/07/2012 19:48:35] me: what do you like?
[07/07/2012 19:48:37] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:48:53] other: I mean, you know, visual porn. XD Stories can be much more psychologically stimulating :D
[07/07/2012 19:49:06] other: Hahahahaha, I'm not sure if I should tell you or not XD
[07/07/2012 19:49:09] other: What do YOU like? XD
[07/07/2012 19:49:15] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 19:49:17] me: so easy

[07/07/2012 19:49:45] me: I like making a girl crazy
[07/07/2012 19:49:48] me: totally crazy
[07/07/2012 19:50:05] me: if I can give her a few orgams before even dropping my pants
[07/07/2012 19:50:06] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:50:15] other: Hahahahaha :D Well that is good to hear.
[07/07/2012 19:50:34] me: I tend to explore
[07/07/2012 19:50:41] me: find the right spots
[07/07/2012 19:50:46] me: and treat them well
[07/07/2012 19:50:51] me: ;)
[07/07/2012 19:51:00] other: Hehe well that sounds appealing ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:51:08] other: As to what I like -
[07/07/2012 19:51:18] other: I like all sorts, but I do tend to sometimes lean a little more towards... uh
[07/07/2012 19:51:23] other: A little BDSM type stuff
[07/07/2012 19:51:23] other: :D
[07/07/2012 19:51:28] me: what?
[07/07/2012 19:51:29] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:51:35] other: Do you know what BDSM is?
[07/07/2012 19:51:39] me: nope
[07/07/2012 19:51:44] other: Oh hahaha
[07/07/2012 19:51:51] other: Uhm
[07/07/2012 19:51:56] other: Probably don't google it
[07/07/2012 19:51:57] me: hmmm
[07/07/2012 19:51:57] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:52:00] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:52:04] other: Did you google it? XD
[07/07/2012 19:52:05] me: too late
[07/07/2012 19:52:09] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:52:21] me: soooooo....
[07/07/2012 19:52:24] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:52:34] other: It's not that uncommon
[07/07/2012 19:52:46] me: but that means you want a hit me?
[07/07/2012 19:52:50] other: No :P
[07/07/2012 19:52:53] other: I'm a "sub".
[07/07/2012 19:52:56] other: I prefer the other way around XD
[07/07/2012 19:52:57] me: oh
[07/07/2012 19:53:04] me: hmmm
[07/07/2012 19:53:16] me: I'll have to learn a little
[07/07/2012 19:53:23] other: It's kind of common for people in high stress jobs, where they have to be in control all the time, to get into that kind of thing XD
[07/07/2012 19:53:27] other: It is very freeing.
[07/07/2012 19:53:35] me: but I think I can do it pretty well ;)
[07/07/2012 19:53:47] other: Hahaha, well, there is no pressure ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:53:55] other: But at that stage I imagine you'd probably get off on it if I was anyway XD
[07/07/2012 19:54:01] other: That is often the case I think.
[07/07/2012 19:54:11] other: One person likes it so the other gets into it too.
[07/07/2012 19:54:14] me: hahaha
[07/07/2012 19:54:27] other: But it isn't like it's a vital thing, it's just yeah, haha, kinky XD
[07/07/2012 19:54:29] me: I've never done that
[07/07/2012 19:54:36] me: so I'm curious
[07/07/2012 19:54:41] other: To be honest it's the main kind of sex I actually have XD
[07/07/2012 19:54:56] other: I've had "vanilla" sex not that many times, though I enjoy it too.
[07/07/2012 19:55:01] me: you actually have?
[07/07/2012 19:55:14] other: Have what, sorry?
[07/07/2012 19:55:23] other: Had BDSM type sex you mean?
[07/07/2012 19:55:27] me: you have sex actually?
[07/07/2012 19:55:29] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:55:34] me: I didn't knew that
[07/07/2012 19:55:47] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:56:02] other: I meant that, normally, when I am having sex it is that kind of sex :P
[07/07/2012 19:56:09] me: oh
[07/07/2012 19:56:12] me: sure?
[07/07/2012 19:56:14] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:56:18] other: XD
[07/07/2012 19:56:22] other: Stop making "actually" sound dirty!
[07/07/2012 19:56:24] other: :D
[07/07/2012 19:56:33] me: ok...
[07/07/2012 19:56:43] me: but you haven't answered
[07/07/2012 19:56:54] other: What didn't I answer? ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:57:08] me: you recently had sex with someone?
[07/07/2012 19:57:18] other: Oh - sorry, no!
[07/07/2012 19:57:24] other: I didn't realize you had asked me that.
[07/07/2012 19:57:29] other: No, I haven't had sex recently.
[07/07/2012 19:57:39] other: I think we had a miscommunication ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:57:39] me: ok ok
[07/07/2012 19:57:44] me: I get it
[07/07/2012 19:57:45] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:57:48] me: sorry
[07/07/2012 19:57:53] me: I was kind of surprised
[07/07/2012 19:57:57] other: What I was saying was that when I do have sex, that is the kind I would normally have - NOT that I have done so recently.
[07/07/2012 19:58:02] me: but now I see what you meant
[07/07/2012 19:58:10] other: I am not planning on anything like that I don't think any time too soon.
[07/07/2012 19:58:21] me: maybe in november?
[07/07/2012 19:58:22] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:58:33] other: Haha yes well that is not too soon I don't think ^-^;
[07/07/2012 19:58:49] other: I just saw the time - it's 3:30am here XD
[07/07/2012 19:58:57] other: I am enjoying our talk but I really should probably go.
[07/07/2012 19:59:02] me: well I think I could like that kind of sex a lot...
[07/07/2012 19:59:05] other: It takes me awhile to fall asleep so yes.
[07/07/2012 19:59:06] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 19:59:11] me: shut up you are not sleepy yet
[07/07/2012 19:59:12] me: xD
[07/07/2012 19:59:14] other: You say that right as I say I should go XD
[07/07/2012 19:59:19] other: I hope so though.
[07/07/2012 19:59:33] other: But it isn't the thing to talk about now as I should be going not distracting myself :D
[07/07/2012 19:59:40] other: And waking myself up talking to you :D
[07/07/2012 19:59:42] me: hmmm
[07/07/2012 19:59:56] other: You haven't even had dinner yet I do not think?
[07/07/2012 20:00:01] other: I don't remember you leaving for it.
[07/07/2012 20:00:03] me: at 20:00 ?
[07/07/2012 20:00:07] me: it's too soon
[07/07/2012 20:00:13] me: I have it at 22:00
[07/07/2012 20:00:14] me: xD
[07/07/2012 20:00:17] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 20:00:26] other: I like late meals too.
[07/07/2012 20:00:32] me: but you should tell me more about it...
[07/07/2012 20:00:36] other: Although with weird hours here it's more "normal".
[07/07/2012 20:00:38] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 20:00:43] other: What do you want to know?
[07/07/2012 20:00:52] other: I will stay 5 more minutes but then it is bedtime.
[07/07/2012 20:01:10] me: do you like your man to insult you or degrade you? or just being hard and nasty?
[07/07/2012 20:01:15] other: Or I will be up too late tomorrow - and I must be up a good time the day after to catch you in your morning.
[07/07/2012 20:01:23] other: Hah, well, during sex, both.
[07/07/2012 20:01:28] other: Never outside of sex, of course.
[07/07/2012 20:01:42] other: It helps if your partner is loving and sweet.
[07/07/2012 20:01:50] other: That way it's just something kinky and different during sex.
[07/07/2012 20:01:52] other: ^-^;
[07/07/2012 20:01:57] me: yeah i see
[07/07/2012 20:02:11] me: but I don't know if I'll be able to insult you...
[07/07/2012 20:02:24] me: maybe you'd feel upset
[07/07/2012 20:02:26] other: Haha well you don't necessarily have to - there are different ways of doing it.
[07/07/2012 20:02:30] other: Haha, no, not during sex.
[07/07/2012 20:02:41] other: It is a different thing - you are always lovely and sweet.
[07/07/2012 20:02:42] me: no not for saying something nasty
[07/07/2012 20:02:46] me: but for not saying it
[07/07/2012 20:02:49] me: U_U
[07/07/2012 20:02:55] other: That makes you a good person to do those things with.
[07/07/2012 20:02:55] me: I'll have to learn
[07/07/2012 20:02:57] other: Oh haha
[07/07/2012 20:03:05] other: Well you don't have to insult directly.
[07/07/2012 20:03:09] me: hahahah
[07/07/2012 20:03:14] other: People get into dirty talk and it gets easier :P
[07/07/2012 20:03:18] me: I figured that on my own...
[07/07/2012 20:03:24] other: Haha
[07/07/2012 20:03:32] other: It's more, uhm... Haha
[07/07/2012 20:03:35] other: This is an odd discussion
[07/07/2012 20:03:36] other: But

[07/07/2012 20:05:36] me: hehe
[07/07/2012 20:05:38] other: Because it takes me ages to fall asleep
[07/07/2012 20:05:49] me: ok...
[07/07/2012 20:05:51] other: Then my hours will be worse and I will get up later, and if that happens we get less time in the morning.
[07/07/2012 20:06:02] other: And I hope we will get a proper call in this week in the morning so I have to be up ;)

[07/07/2012 20:07:46] other: But I am glad :)
[07/07/2012 20:08:04] me: what I think it's better about sex is not doing the same again and again
[07/07/2012 20:08:16] other: Yes, it is good to do different things.
[07/07/2012 20:08:18] me: it could be awesome in so many ways
[07/07/2012 20:08:28] other: And I think in a good relationship you should be able to do all the things you want with your partner.
[07/07/2012 20:08:43] other: Because you get comfortable with each other and yeah, I think people should do that more.
[07/07/2012 20:08:51] me: either painting a line with my hands through your whole body...
[07/07/2012 20:09:00] other: Hahahahahaha :D

[08/07/2012 9:03:27] other: I find Moai coords very confusing.
[08/07/2012 9:03:47] me: every different thing seems to have its own rules
[08/07/2012 9:04:15] me: though I'm pretty sure it's 0,0 at the center of the app
[08/07/2012 9:04:34] other: Yeah it is I think, normally.
[08/07/2012 9:04:36] me: I'm working by guess, haven't read anything about it yet xD
[08/07/2012 9:04:51] other: I hadn't read anything but I think noticed that when doing first tutorials.
[08/07/2012 9:05:03] me: about threads...
[08/07/2012 9:05:08] me: they are not so confusing
[08/07/2012 9:05:13] other: No?
[08/07/2012 9:05:22] me: they are as little apps on themselves
[08/07/2012 9:05:29] me: you can pause and resume threads
[08/07/2012 9:05:39] me: a lot like transitions in corona
[08/07/2012 9:05:50] me: you can do many at a time
[08/07/2012 9:05:54] other: Hmmmm. It will take me sometime to learn about those I expect.
[08/07/2012 9:05:57] me: and pause resume whatever
[08/07/2012 9:06:14] me: look I have 2 different threads
[08/07/2012 9:06:24] me: one at the menu for rolling the peach
[08/07/2012 9:06:39] me: the same takes care of the falling coronas at the game scene
[08/07/2012 9:06:48] me: but I needed another one for the peach shots
[08/07/2012 9:06:57] me: so while one goes down the other goes up
[08/07/2012 9:07:11] other: It is quite confusing XD
[08/07/2012 9:07:21] me: hmmm
[08/07/2012 9:07:28] me: tell me, how do you see them right now?
[08/07/2012 9:07:55] me: just like something you put there cos otherwise doesn't work? or maybe you have some opinions, even if they're wrong?
[08/07/2012 9:07:57] other: I don't know, I don't see them in any way - I am still getting my head around it I think.
[08/07/2012 9:08:08] other: I will have opinions and questions soon I imagine ;)
[08/07/2012 9:08:12] me: ok
[08/07/2012 9:08:23] me: think of it as a multiprocessor app
[08/07/2012 9:08:28] me: even if it's not like that
[08/07/2012 9:08:34] me: every cpu handles one task
[08/07/2012 9:08:39] me: that's a thread
[08/07/2012 9:08:59] me: so the app is a compound of many things happening at once
[08/07/2012 9:09:04] me: following their own path
[08/07/2012 9:09:32] other: I kind of get that.
[08/07/2012 9:09:37] other: I will understand better when I play with code.
[08/07/2012 9:09:39] other: ;)
[08/07/2012 9:09:42] me: :)
[08/07/2012 9:09:51] other: Maybe anyway :D
[08/07/2012 9:09:56] other: Thank you, that is a good way of explaining it.
[08/07/2012 9:10:08] me: :)
[08/07/2012 9:10:21] me: don't have to thank me
[08/07/2012 9:10:25] me: we are a team on this
[08/07/2012 9:10:40] me: and as for the sound... is very simple
[08/07/2012 9:11:04] me: just after opening the first window you call this
[08/07/2012 9:11:05] me: MOAIUntzSystem.initialize()
[08/07/2012 9:11:29] me: and the you load a sound like this
[08/07/2012 9:11:31] me:  pewS = MOAIUntzSound.new()
 pewS:load('sound/pew.wav')
 pewS:setVolume(1)
 pewS:setLooping(false)
[08/07/2012 9:11:44] me: (don't use ogg, it has issues)
[08/07/2012 9:12:03] other: I see. How do you play it?
[08/07/2012 9:12:06] me: pewS:play()
[08/07/2012 9:12:07] me: :D
[08/07/2012 9:12:23] other: Hah, cool :D
[08/07/2012 9:12:39] other: I guess when you learn it isn't so bad.
[08/07/2012 9:12:44] other: FYI I always use " rather than '
[08/07/2012 9:12:46] other: :P
[08/07/2012 9:12:59] me: rather than?
[08/07/2012 9:13:15] other: I mean
[08/07/2012 9:13:17] other: "
[08/07/2012 9:13:22] other: rather than
[08/07/2012 9:13:23] other: '
[08/07/2012 9:13:28] other: The double and single quotes.
[08/07/2012 9:13:33] other: " and '
[08/07/2012 9:13:38] me: oh
[08/07/2012 9:13:47] other: I also avoid _ ;)
[08/07/2012 9:13:55] other: But I know you want to do it to irritate Carlos :D
[08/07/2012 9:13:58] me: a lot
[08/07/2012 9:13:59] me: xD
[08/07/2012 9:14:06] other: Hahahaha
[08/07/2012 9:14:23] other: I should be working but I don't want to. How late do you stay up Sundays?
[08/07/2012 9:14:46] me: well, until 23:00 or so
[08/07/2012 9:15:02] me: mondays are hard xD
[08/07/2012 9:15:11] other: Yeah I can imagine XD
[08/07/2012 9:15:33] me: but I'm waking up at office times this weekend
[08/07/2012 9:15:37] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 9:15:45] me: so no real improvement in sleep hours
[08/07/2012 9:15:52] other: That is not so good XD
[08/07/2012 9:16:00] me: it is ^_^
[08/07/2012 9:16:14] other: I should maybe go do some work >.<'
[08/07/2012 9:16:23] other: I have a lot of emails.
[08/07/2012 9:16:37] me: have you ever tried accidentally deleting all of them?
[08/07/2012 9:16:39] me: xD
[08/07/2012 9:16:44] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 9:16:45] me: you know, things happen
[08/07/2012 9:16:50] other: I wish, but no :P
[08/07/2012 9:17:02] other: I try so hard to be nice.
[08/07/2012 9:17:02] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 9:17:04] other: For now (devil)
[08/07/2012 9:17:09] other: One day I'll snap ;)
[08/07/2012 9:17:09] me: yeah
[08/07/2012 9:17:19] other: Not really, but yeah, one day I may just delete them all :D
[08/07/2012 9:17:19] me: and well throw peaches at them
[08/07/2012 9:17:20] me: xD
[08/07/2012 9:17:22] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 9:17:23] other: Yes, exactly.
[08/07/2012 9:17:36] me: I just got a noob question this morning
[08/07/2012 9:17:39] me: it's rare
[08/07/2012 9:17:40] me: xD
[08/07/2012 9:17:44] other: Hah, what was it?
[08/07/2012 9:17:49] me: about my dpad
[08/07/2012 9:17:58] me: he told me the dpad.lua file is hidden!!!
[08/07/2012 9:18:01] me: wtf
[08/07/2012 9:18:01] me: xD

[08/07/2012 10:02:18] me: up for a little code cleaning and I'll send it ;)
[08/07/2012 10:02:46] other: Beth is here trying to tell me what she wants for our birthday, even though it's almost a month away XD (So I am a tad distracted.)
[08/07/2012 10:02:55] other: I'd like to see it :)
[08/07/2012 10:03:10] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 10:03:38] me: let me know when she finally tells you ;)
[08/07/2012 10:04:56] other: She is currently telling me a list of things, mostly makeup, I can pick from to get her.
[08/07/2012 10:05:05] other: She's asking me what I want too and I have no idea XD
[08/07/2012 10:05:15] other: (She is walking in and out of the room waiting for the kettle to boil.)
[08/07/2012 10:05:21] me: xD
[08/07/2012 10:05:26] me: no idea?
[08/07/2012 10:05:34] me: don't you want anything?
[08/07/2012 10:05:54] me: that will be cheap then xD
[08/07/2012 10:06:12] other: Hahahaha :D I don't want anything from you, you have already sent me plenty!
[08/07/2012 10:06:31] me: you know that's not a possibility ;)
[08/07/2012 10:06:53] other: It's an odd year for me and will be a bit weird, I think. I haven't been single for a birthday in ages. So I guess it isn't really as exciting as some birthdays because it still feels odd.
[08/07/2012 10:06:59] other: It is a possibility!
[08/07/2012 10:07:03] other: You can send me a card :)
[08/07/2012 10:07:08] me: hahahahaha
[08/07/2012 10:07:16] me: no way I'm sending you ONLY a card
[08/07/2012 10:07:20] me: ;)
[08/07/2012 10:07:25] other: I don't need anything else ^-^;
[08/07/2012 10:07:47] me: then I'll think in something you don't need but appreciate to have
[08/07/2012 10:07:50] me: ^_^
[08/07/2012 10:08:00] other: I would appreciate a card :)
[08/07/2012 10:08:18] me: ok...
[08/07/2012 10:08:24] me: but not enough :D
[08/07/2012 10:08:45] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 10:08:50] other: We will see.
[08/07/2012 10:08:54] other: I think it is plenty :)
[08/07/2012 10:09:15] other: Most people will not even remember it, so a card is great :)
[08/07/2012 10:09:28] me: 5th of august
[08/07/2012 10:09:36] other: Haha yes, you know when it is XD
[08/07/2012 10:09:42] me: I can't ever forget
[08/07/2012 10:10:03] me: even if some close ones can't remember and I have to keep reminding them
[08/07/2012 10:10:04] me: xD
[08/07/2012 10:10:25] other: Haha I am not good with Birthdays either, I have to write them down mostly.
[08/07/2012 10:10:36] other: I just looked at yours on FB to make sure it was on my calendar.
[08/07/2012 10:10:36] other: ^-^;
[08/07/2012 10:10:41] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 10:10:51] me: you forgot about it this year!
[08/07/2012 10:10:52] other: Sorry - haha, I am hopeless with dates mostly.
[08/07/2012 10:10:54] me: xD
[08/07/2012 10:10:56] other: I just realized that.
[08/07/2012 10:11:01] other: while looking at it.
[08/07/2012 10:11:02] other: >.<'
[08/07/2012 10:11:06] me: hahahaha
[08/07/2012 10:11:07] other: That makes me feel terrible!
[08/07/2012 10:11:11] other: XD I'm sorry!
[08/07/2012 10:11:13] me: NO!
[08/07/2012 10:11:16] me: it's ok
[08/07/2012 10:11:19] other: That is so horrible of me!
[08/07/2012 10:11:21] other: >.<'
[08/07/2012 10:11:26] me: so much was happening at your end
[08/07/2012 10:11:30] me: don't worry
[08/07/2012 10:11:35] other: That doesn't make it OK, though.
[08/07/2012 10:11:41] other: I hate that I forgot it >.<' Sorry.
[08/07/2012 10:11:48] me: you'll have to please me in another way of course, but it's ok
[08/07/2012 10:11:49] me: xD
[08/07/2012 10:12:08] other: Hahaha :D
[08/07/2012 10:12:24] other: Nonetheless, I am very sorry for forgetting it.
[08/07/2012 10:12:35] me: I know but I don't really mind
[08/07/2012 10:12:44] me: when you realised you forgot you just told me
[08/07/2012 10:12:47] me: so it's ok
[08/07/2012 10:12:53] other: I felt so bad when I realized, especially because you remembered mine even last year.
[08/07/2012 10:13:01] other: And I ate a delicious cake because of it :D
[08/07/2012 10:13:05] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 10:13:12] me: one thing is for sure
[08/07/2012 10:13:15] me: no cake this year
[08/07/2012 10:13:31] me: as you are with your family and probably get one anyway
[08/07/2012 10:13:44] me: so I turn my looks to other things...
[08/07/2012 10:13:47] me: ;)
[08/07/2012 10:13:55] other: Hah, like I said, just a card will be lovely.
[08/07/2012 10:14:08] other: You will be probably one of the only people I know online to remember it.
[08/07/2012 10:14:22] other: I think maybe one or two others, but they wouldn't send cards.
[08/07/2012 10:14:26] me: hahahaha a card...
[08/07/2012 10:14:29] me: HAHAHAHAHA
[08/07/2012 10:14:30] other: So a card is more than enough ^-^;
[08/07/2012 10:14:32] other: XD
[08/07/2012 10:14:47] other: I don't need a gift. I have plenty of gifts from you.
[08/07/2012 10:14:57] other: Choco is back on my desk now too, by the way. Not sure if I told you that or not.
[08/07/2012 10:15:02] me: and you haven't seen anything yet ;)

[08/07/2012 10:15:26] me: maybe he can be friends with little peach
[08/07/2012 10:15:37] other: Yes, I am sure they can be good friends.
[08/07/2012 10:16:03] other: Give me a little while to finish a couple more emails and then I will say hello again and check out Moai stuff you've done before I have to do forum - OK? :)
[08/07/2012 10:16:17] me: I've noticed your slowlyness ;)

[08/07/2012 12:29:44] me: sausages are good :D
[08/07/2012 12:29:57] other: Yes they are :) Had some cooked onion with them too. Was nice.
[08/07/2012 12:30:04] other: Am very full now, will probably go for a cig shortly.
[08/07/2012 12:30:11] other: Though I have to go do forum stuff too >.<'

[08/07/2012 12:30:38] other: Of the forum I haven't done any yet, of emails I probably have about 2 hours worth left.
[08/07/2012 12:30:49] me: woah...
[08/07/2012 12:30:54] me: better get it done
[08/07/2012 12:31:01] other: That is why I am always busy XD
[08/07/2012 12:31:02] me: I have something to discuss after that
[08/07/2012 12:31:05] other: Too much work!
[08/07/2012 12:31:07] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 12:31:16] other: Hah, do you want to discuss it first? We can if you prefer.
[08/07/2012 12:31:23] me: no no

[08/07/2012 12:31:47] other: It is good you are learning - I need more time to do the same.
[08/07/2012 12:31:54] other: One of these days I will take a day off,  haha.
[08/07/2012 12:32:08] me: if it's on wednesday we could talk a little ;)
[08/07/2012 12:32:19] me: I won't go working at morning
[08/07/2012 12:32:32] other: I may be around then, I don't know yet ^-^;
[08/07/2012 12:32:35] me: have to get the passport and I'll be free until my 15:00
[08/07/2012 12:32:43] other: Ah I see.
[08/07/2012 12:32:50] other: Yes, passports are a lot of messing around.
[08/07/2012 12:32:56] other: I remember getting mine was quite a pain.
[08/07/2012 12:33:10] me: I don't think is such a pain here
[08/07/2012 12:33:18] me: just a phone call and half an hour of waiting
[08/07/2012 12:33:25] me: then it'll be done
[08/07/2012 12:33:32] other: Here it was a huge pain.
[08/07/2012 12:33:42] other: It took a long time and LOTS of paperwork and proof of who I was.
[08/07/2012 12:33:50] me: hahahaha
[08/07/2012 12:33:53] other: I actually had to get a copy of my father's birth certificate and everything.
[08/07/2012 12:34:04] me: nobody knows the real Peach!
[08/07/2012 12:34:12] me: just a few fortunates
[08/07/2012 12:35:05] other: one sec
[08/07/2012 12:35:10] me: ok
[08/07/2012 12:38:38] other: Sorry, mother was talking to me.
[08/07/2012 12:38:46] other: And yes, haha, pretty much no one knows the real Peach.
[08/07/2012 12:38:48] me: no worries
[08/07/2012 12:38:55] other: I think I could count them on one hand.
[08/07/2012 12:39:14] me: ^_^
[08/07/2012 12:39:18] other: You, Carlos, Cleo, Jenny ^-^;
[08/07/2012 12:39:26] other: Then a few others have a good idea but not the whole picture, like you four do.
[08/07/2012 12:39:36] me: I talked a bit with Jenny a couple days ago
[08/07/2012 12:39:41] other: Did you?
[08/07/2012 12:39:45] me: yep
[08/07/2012 12:39:48] other: She is lovely.
[08/07/2012 12:39:52] other: What were you chatting about?
[08/07/2012 12:39:57] me: I had yet to greet them for their child

[08/07/2012 12:40:30] me: that
[08/07/2012 12:40:31] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:40:34] other: Or you could say "grat" or "grats" as an abbreviation.
[08/07/2012 12:40:39] other: I called her when he was born.
[08/07/2012 12:40:42] me: nice
[08/07/2012 12:40:44] other: I was in the US at the time.
[08/07/2012 12:40:53] other: :)
[08/07/2012 12:41:01] other: I hope to meet her eventually.
[08/07/2012 12:41:13] me: he was kind of hiding that he had a female partner at first xD
[08/07/2012 12:41:24] other: She XD
[08/07/2012 12:41:25] me: tought I already knew for reading it somewhere
[08/07/2012 12:41:29] other: You said "he" twice there :P
[08/07/2012 12:41:32] me: oops
[08/07/2012 12:41:34] me: she
[08/07/2012 12:41:40] me: xD yeah sorry!!!
[08/07/2012 12:41:40] other: Yes, her partner and her have been together a long time I think.
[08/07/2012 12:41:45] me: 7 years
[08/07/2012 12:41:48] me: it's nice
[08/07/2012 12:41:58] other: I remember my first visit to the US was when she told me that she (the partner) was pregnant :)
[08/07/2012 12:42:04] other: I was so happy for them, they will make wonderful parents.
[08/07/2012 12:42:09] me: if theres love in and they are goot mothers i could never have something wrong with that
[08/07/2012 12:42:20] me: oooooooooooooo
[08/07/2012 12:42:22] me: good
[08/07/2012 12:42:26] me: ARGH
[08/07/2012 12:42:37] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 12:42:39] other: Glad to hear that.
[08/07/2012 12:42:48] me: my fingers don't respond quite well today
[08/07/2012 12:42:49] other: One of the things I hate in this world is homophobia.
[08/07/2012 12:42:55] me: was up until very late for the moai thing
[08/07/2012 12:42:56] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:43:13] other: Too many people have an objection to it. (I should clarify I am bisexual, though I tend to date men not women most of the time.)
[08/07/2012 12:43:18] other: Hahaha yeah, Moai will do that to you :D
[08/07/2012 12:43:31] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 12:43:36] me: even more competition!!!
[08/07/2012 12:43:42] me: holy crap Peach
[08/07/2012 12:43:43] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:43:46] other: Hahaha XD
[08/07/2012 12:43:50] other: It isn't more competition.
[08/07/2012 12:43:57] other: I don't date women very often any more.
[08/07/2012 12:44:05] other: Don't worry XD
[08/07/2012 12:44:11] me: hmmmm
[08/07/2012 12:44:15] me: but that makes me think
[08/07/2012 12:44:24] other: I am not looking for women OR men right now, I've not been single so long yet.
[08/07/2012 12:44:31] me: and you probably know what I'm thinking right now xD
[08/07/2012 12:45:01] other: XD I could guess. Most guys think about threesomes when they hear that.
[08/07/2012 12:45:14] me: shit... that makes me like most guys
[08/07/2012 12:45:32] other: My rule for threesomes are simply, it's only OK to do with 2 girls if you are also willing to have a threesome with 2 guys XD
[08/07/2012 12:45:33] me: ok... I haven't said anything...
[08/07/2012 12:45:37] other: Otherwise you don't do it :D
[08/07/2012 12:45:44] me: hmmmm
[08/07/2012 12:45:46] me: ok
[08/07/2012 12:45:54] me: no threesome then xD
[08/07/2012 12:46:06] other: I know most guys have a problem with that, haha.
[08/07/2012 12:46:20] other: It's just a double standard thing, it's either both or neither for me ^-^;
[08/07/2012 12:46:21] me: yeah... I'm not bisexual
[08/07/2012 12:46:45] other: I know that - though when there is a threesome with two guys the guys don't do stuff with eachother ^-^;
[08/07/2012 12:46:49] other: They both do stuff with the girl.
[08/07/2012 12:46:55] me: fffff
[08/07/2012 12:47:01] other: But yes, I know many guys don't want to do that either, which is fine too.
[08/07/2012 12:47:03] other: Lol :D
[08/07/2012 12:47:10] me: I thought about it just a sec
[08/07/2012 12:47:14] me: I don't like it
[08/07/2012 12:47:16] me: not a bit
[08/07/2012 12:47:30] other: Haha, well, what is the difference with two girls? :)
[08/07/2012 12:47:31] me: I'd probably hit the other guy to death
[08/07/2012 12:47:35] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:47:40] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 12:47:54] me: there's no difference you are totally right
[08/07/2012 12:48:04] me: so I won't even ask again
[08/07/2012 12:48:05] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:48:17] other: Hah
[08/07/2012 12:48:24] other: It's OK, I just mean, yes, it's one of those things.
[08/07/2012 12:48:32] other: If it doesn't go both ways couples can have problems.
[08/07/2012 12:48:37] me: true
[08/07/2012 12:48:38] other: Because one feels it is unfair etc.
[08/07/2012 12:48:47] other: So it's better to be upfront about it :)
[08/07/2012 12:48:53] me: yeah you are totally tru
[08/07/2012 12:48:56] me: true
[08/07/2012 12:49:14] me: sharing a loved one... I've never been good at that...
[08/07/2012 12:49:15] other: I am trying to import mp3s for my mother's player, haha, so slow from CD.
[08/07/2012 12:49:45] me: even if it was with two girls the other one would probably get bored xD
[08/07/2012 12:49:52] other: Hahahaha
[08/07/2012 12:50:15] other: Well, it depends, sometimes if both girls are bisexual it can be weird.
[08/07/2012 12:50:20] other: They can focus too much on each other.
[08/07/2012 12:50:22] other: And not the guy XD
[08/07/2012 12:50:37] me: then I'd hit the girl
[08/07/2012 12:50:38] me: xD
[08/07/2012 12:50:43] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 12:50:52] other: You are the jealous type I think :D
[08/07/2012 12:50:59] me: not much
[08/07/2012 12:51:04] me: really not a lot
[08/07/2012 12:51:10] me: but I have my moments
[08/07/2012 12:51:23] me: when I'm in love I'm totally dedicated...
[08/07/2012 12:51:29] me: so I kind of expect the same
[08/07/2012 12:51:38] other: Haha, well, I don't think a bit of jealousy is a bad thing you know.
[08/07/2012 12:51:42] me: I'll never lie in a relationship, not even show any interest on other girls
[08/07/2012 12:51:58] me: I get focused
[08/07/2012 12:52:00] me: :D
[08/07/2012 12:52:09] other: Yes, that is the way to be. Guys who show interest in other girls while in a relationship make their partner feel sad.
[08/07/2012 12:52:35] other: There is a saying "A boy makes his girlfriend jealous of other girls, while a gentleman makes other girls jealous of his girlfriend."
[08/07/2012 12:52:44] me: :)
[08/07/2012 12:52:48] other: That saying is about that - about not showing interest in other girls. It is where it comes from ;)
[08/07/2012 12:52:50] other: :)*
[08/07/2012 12:52:51] me: they will all be jealous
[08/07/2012 12:53:01] other: Haha I know, because you are a sweetie :*
[08/07/2012 12:53:06] me: :*
[08/07/2012 12:53:25] me: and I'm studying a lot hahahaha... but let's leave that for later
[08/07/2012 12:53:47] other: Hahaha it took me a second to realize what I think you mean you are studying :D
[08/07/2012 12:53:52] other: At first I thought you meant Moai XD
[08/07/2012 12:53:57] me: I know xD
[08/07/2012 12:53:59] other: Then I was like "ohhhh, maybe he doesn't mean that!"
[08/07/2012 12:54:00] other: XD
[08/07/2012 12:54:02] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 12:54:07] other: I am a bit slow sometimes ;)
[08/07/2012 12:54:21] me: I like that xD
[08/07/2012 12:54:36] me: I can still catch you at some things xD
[08/07/2012 12:54:59] other: Hah
[08/07/2012 12:55:13] me: I'm usually predictable, but always ready for a surprise ;)
[08/07/2012 12:55:42] other: ^-^;
[08/07/2012 12:55:53] other: OK - I should go to have a cigarette and do the forum.
[08/07/2012 12:56:03] other: My mother wants me to put heaps of music on for her tonight and I must do work first.
[08/07/2012 12:56:14] me: ok! I'll make lunch and eat it
[08/07/2012 12:56:21] other: OK, talk again in awhile :)
[08/07/2012 12:56:29] me: yep, not so long
[08/07/2012 12:56:36] other: Te amo
[08/07/2012 12:56:37] me: and be sure to be in privacy later xD
[08/07/2012 12:56:49] me: :*!!! Love you Peachy!!!
[08/07/2012 12:56:58] other: Haha yes, well, by the time I am done working I should be alone as others will be asleep I imagine.

[08/07/2012 14:09:12] me: today I'm doing probably the hardest work I've ever done
[08/07/2012 14:09:12] other: Heh, hi. :)
[08/07/2012 14:09:19] me: :)
[08/07/2012 14:09:22] me: hi

[08/07/2012 14:10:42] me: but want to talk?
[08/07/2012 14:11:05] other: Well, I should keep working but you said you were done with lunch so I thought I'd say hello.

[08/07/2012 14:11:30] me: just please, don't forget about me today
[08/07/2012 14:11:35] other: XD
[08/07/2012 14:11:40] other: When have I forgotten about you?
[08/07/2012 14:11:43] me: never
[08/07/2012 14:11:47] me: but today specially
[08/07/2012 14:11:56] other: Hah, don't worry, I wont forget about you :P
[08/07/2012 14:12:00] other: I will take awhile with work.
[08/07/2012 14:12:06] other: But I wont forget.
[08/07/2012 14:12:06] other: :)

[08/07/2012 14:12:43] other: Thank you :) I appreciate that.
[08/07/2012 14:25:53] me: just because you could be thinking bad about me right now... I'm not obssessed at anything, just trying to be the one you'd want to be with you forever... (and I'm not jerking off! - though it's hard to resist xD)
[08/07/2012 14:26:27] me: that sure distracts you a bit... xD
[08/07/2012 14:26:35] me: get back to work! we'll talk later
[08/07/2012 14:28:49] other: Haha XD

[08/07/2012 14:29:14] other: Try not to jerk off though XD Although I guess it's the weekend and you don't have to be working.
[08/07/2012 14:29:15] other: XD
[08/07/2012 14:29:23] other: I do though, so I shall talk to you more soon :D
[08/07/2012 14:29:38] me: nope I won't, this is for scientifical purposes
[08/07/2012 14:29:40] me: xD
[08/07/2012 14:29:44] me: have to be serious at it
[08/07/2012 14:29:59] other: Hahahahahaha - yes, you're a scientist XD

[08/07/2012 14:56:42] me: I tend to smile only with one side xD
[08/07/2012 14:56:57] me: it makes me look a little weird I know...
[08/07/2012 14:57:20] other: No, I do that too often enough.
[08/07/2012 14:57:24] other: It looks nice - good photo :)
[08/07/2012 14:57:39] me: ^_^
[08/07/2012 14:57:48] other: I like it.
[08/07/2012 14:57:53] me: I'll take one with the passport when I finally have it too
[08/07/2012 14:58:09] other: Hah, yes, that is a good idea.
[08/07/2012 14:58:11] other: I did that too.
[08/07/2012 14:58:15] me: and maybe tweet it to carlos
[08/07/2012 14:58:17] me: xD
[08/07/2012 14:58:29] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 14:58:36] other: I wonder if he will think you are more serious then ^-^;
[08/07/2012 14:58:45] me: who knows...
[08/07/2012 14:58:47] other: Maybe that is why he laughed; he did not think you were serious ^-^;
[08/07/2012 14:58:56] me: probably
[08/07/2012 14:59:04] other: Or he thinks you are too good for me ;)
[08/07/2012 14:59:09] me: but I'm more serious about this than anything else in my life
[08/07/2012 14:59:14] me: ha!
[08/07/2012 14:59:25] me: Carlos thinking something better about me rather than you?
[08/07/2012 14:59:28] me: impossible...
[08/07/2012 14:59:37] other: Hahahaha I don't think he thinks that much of me.
[08/07/2012 14:59:38] me: simply can't happen
[08/07/2012 14:59:43] other: He would know you are smarter.
[08/07/2012 14:59:58] other: And I think he thinks I am not that pretty either because I don't wear makeup ;)
[08/07/2012 14:59:59] me: I've been coding for longer yeah
[08/07/2012 15:00:05] me: that doesn't make me smarter
[08/07/2012 15:00:05] other: So he may very well think you are too good for me.
[08/07/2012 15:00:09] me: just more experienced
[08/07/2012 15:00:31] other: Hah, well, perhaps. I do not know how his mind works - but he knows I am just a normal person I think.
[08/07/2012 15:00:36] other: You don't think so, I know ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:00:49] other: But he knows me in person now, he has seen me cry, seen be very insecure, etc.
[08/07/2012 15:00:54] other: So he knows I have plenty of flaws :D
[08/07/2012 15:01:07] me: and you think you are the only one with flaws?
[08/07/2012 15:01:13] me: we are people...
[08/07/2012 15:01:15] other: No but he has seen more of mine than yours ;)
[08/07/2012 15:01:21] other: So he may think you are too good for me.
[08/07/2012 15:01:42] me: I cried a lot that night you told me so much about inside
[08/07/2012 15:02:08] me: and cried and been very bad when was quitting drugs
[08/07/2012 15:02:17] other: I understand that. That was a very hard thing for everyone who cared about Ansca and Carlos to deal with. I cried a lot when I learned about that.
[08/07/2012 15:02:18] me: I have lots of flaws
[08/07/2012 15:02:26] other: Hah well yes, but that is OK, that is not so bad.
[08/07/2012 15:02:28] other: But
[08/07/2012 15:02:32] other: Carlos has actually *seen* mine.
[08/07/2012 15:02:35] other: In person.
[08/07/2012 15:02:37] other: So he knows them more XD
[08/07/2012 15:02:43] other: He thinks I am weak, I think :D
[08/07/2012 15:02:47] other: Because I cry too easily.
[08/07/2012 15:02:50] other: At least I think he thinks I do.
[08/07/2012 15:03:05] other: I don't cry that easily, really ^-^; But he thinks I do.
[08/07/2012 15:03:08] me: I think he just hates seeing you cry
[08/07/2012 15:03:17] other: He does hate it, I know XD
[08/07/2012 15:03:28] other: I could tell :D
[08/07/2012 15:03:32] me: hehe
[08/07/2012 15:03:37] me: and who wouldn't...
[08/07/2012 15:03:47] other: Well I don't know if it is because he was sad for me though ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:03:52] me: I just want to make you cry of happiness ;)
[08/07/2012 15:03:55] other: I think it was more about the fact I was being so weak XD
[08/07/2012 15:03:58] other: Hah, I know you do <3
[08/07/2012 15:04:16] me: no don't worry
[08/07/2012 15:04:25] me: he knows you are stronger than me
[08/07/2012 15:04:27] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:04:33] other: Hah, I doubt he thinks that at all XD
[08/07/2012 15:04:40] other: He has seen me very weak.
[08/07/2012 15:04:46] other: He would not have seen you so weak.
[08/07/2012 15:04:53] me: well he told me not to be so worry about you getting into moai
[08/07/2012 15:05:03] me: he was worried too, but tried to calm me down a lot
[08/07/2012 15:05:14] other: What part of it were you/he worried about?
[08/07/2012 15:05:33] me: about not being what you used to be
[08/07/2012 15:05:48] me: as the platform wouldn't attract so many newbies
[08/07/2012 15:05:49] other: With the community and stuff?
[08/07/2012 15:06:10] me: yeah in a way yes
[08/07/2012 15:06:24] me: we both know you'll learn it good
[08/07/2012 15:07:13] me: but moai's community... yeah well... it doesn't taste so Peachy yet xD
[08/07/2012 15:07:21] other: It doesn't, no :D
[08/07/2012 15:07:33] other: Was Carlos worried about that too?
[08/07/2012 15:07:40] me: we both were
[08/07/2012 15:07:48] other: I am glad he helped you to worry less, though.
[08/07/2012 15:08:01] other: What did he say to make you worry less? Do you remember? (I admit I worry about it too sometimes.)
[08/07/2012 15:08:11] other: I want to be able to be a big part of a community, as you know.
[08/07/2012 15:08:17] other: It is very important to me.
[08/07/2012 15:08:32] me: well he just told me you were a smart girl, and you'll find the way to have your place
[08/07/2012 15:08:48] other: Hah - that sounds like him :D
[08/07/2012 15:08:55] other: I hope he's right. I think he is.
[08/07/2012 15:08:59] other: I would find a way.
[08/07/2012 15:09:00] other: :)
[08/07/2012 15:09:04] me: I do too
[08/07/2012 15:09:14] me: he doesn't lie, he just hide things
[08/07/2012 15:09:16] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:09:25] me: sio when he talks iI think I can trust him
[08/07/2012 15:09:29] me: so
[08/07/2012 15:09:34] me: woah I
[08/07/2012 15:09:35] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:09:42] other: That is true. I trust him always.
[08/07/2012 15:09:46] other: Even if some things he cannot say ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:10:04] other: Though I wish he could tell us more, of course.
[08/07/2012 15:10:15] me: yeah...
[08/07/2012 15:10:22] me: maybe about the offer i told you
[08/07/2012 15:10:35] me: you remember that right?
[08/07/2012 15:10:37] other: Yeah, it would be nice to know more about those things.
[08/07/2012 15:10:40] other: Yes, of course :)
[08/07/2012 15:10:51] other: It was very moving for me :)
[08/07/2012 15:11:00] other: (Though I also remember it is a secret ;) of course)
[08/07/2012 15:11:01] me: ^_^
[08/07/2012 15:11:12] me: yeah but not between us anymore
[08/07/2012 15:11:23] other: No, not between us :)
[08/07/2012 15:11:28] other: Which is good.
[08/07/2012 15:11:36] other: Thank you again for telling me about it, honestly it was a very good thing to know about.
[08/07/2012 15:11:49] me: i think he really wants to get where he is been asked to
[08/07/2012 15:12:08] me: :* if it makes my Peach happy I have enough thanks
[08/07/2012 15:12:19] other: Heh <3
[08/07/2012 15:12:46] other: Sorry, I misread the above - you mean you think he has an offer he wants to accept you think?
[08/07/2012 15:12:52] me: i think yes
[08/07/2012 15:13:10] me: or maybe he just thinks it couldn't be so bad
[08/07/2012 15:13:14] me: but kind of
[08/07/2012 15:13:17] other: Do you think he will accept it, then?
[08/07/2012 15:13:22] other: I talk to him a little about these things but not so much lately.
[08/07/2012 15:13:27] other: We more talk about other work things.
[08/07/2012 15:13:27] me: don't know...
[08/07/2012 15:13:40] other: Is there a reason he wouldn't accept that one?
[08/07/2012 15:13:50] me: oh not some other
[08/07/2012 15:14:00] me: the same he doesnt want to accept for you
[08/07/2012 15:14:05] other: Oh I see.
[08/07/2012 15:14:12] me: sorry for confusing
[08/07/2012 15:14:14] other: But you think he does want that one?
[08/07/2012 15:14:24] other: It's OK, it will happen sometimes. I am easily confused at times ;)
[08/07/2012 15:14:31] me: i think he does at least a little
[08/07/2012 15:14:49] other: I would love to work with him, I'd give almost anything for that - but I would prefer he was happy.
[08/07/2012 15:14:54] me: but as i don't know what that is...
[08/07/2012 15:15:15] other: He will do what is right for him at the end of the day I think.
[08/07/2012 15:15:19] other: We just have to have faith in him :)
[08/07/2012 15:15:31] me: ok, thats easy
[08/07/2012 15:15:41] other: Exactly :)
[08/07/2012 15:16:01] me: :) i'm jealous about Carlos a lot believe me...
[08/07/2012 15:16:02] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:16:06] other: Even if he doesn't have faith in us somethings :P Haha, we will tweet him a pic of us hanging out.
[08/07/2012 15:16:13] other: Hah, why are you jealous about him?
[08/07/2012 15:16:28] me: for you! xD
[08/07/2012 15:16:40] other: Hah, why? ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:16:41] me: in a healthy way
[08/07/2012 15:16:56] me: but I admire how much he got you catched
[08/07/2012 15:17:19] other: Can you reword that last sentence?
[08/07/2012 15:17:25] other: "catched" doesn't quite make sense to me.
[08/07/2012 15:17:29] other: Sorry!
[08/07/2012 15:17:39] me: how much you care about him
[08/07/2012 15:17:50] me: and love him
[08/07/2012 15:17:57] me: I'm jealous for that
[08/07/2012 15:17:57] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:18:06] other: Haha well I love and care about you too, you know :)
[08/07/2012 15:18:18] me: if you asked for a bit of jealousy it's there
[08/07/2012 15:18:20] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:18:31] other: Heh, I know.
[08/07/2012 15:18:59] me: but i aslo like the situation
[08/07/2012 15:19:03] me: as we discussed

[08/07/2012 15:19:28] me: hahahah
[08/07/2012 15:19:37] other: Which one, the one of your passport or the one of us? :D
[08/07/2012 15:19:44] me: the one of us
[08/07/2012 15:19:55] other: Yeah, haha, well, he shouldn't have laughed at you ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:19:56] me: he won't think i'm too serious just for having papers
[08/07/2012 15:19:57] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:20:02] other: Hahahaha
[08/07/2012 15:20:17] other: We can make a sign for the picture. "Hi Carlos!"
[08/07/2012 15:20:22] other: "HAHAHAHA"
[08/07/2012 15:20:24] other: :P
[08/07/2012 15:20:24] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:20:37] me: the tongue smiley included
[08/07/2012 15:20:42] other: Hahaha, indeed.
[08/07/2012 15:20:51] other: He might fall off his chair :D
[08/07/2012 15:21:03] me: i can clearly see that xD
[08/07/2012 15:21:11] me: and so many others indeed...
[08/07/2012 15:21:17] other: Yes XD
[08/07/2012 15:21:24] other: I imagine I would get many emails.
[08/07/2012 15:21:34] other: My ex also might shit himself XD
[08/07/2012 15:21:39] me: who's that ugly guy??? You have to be with me!!!
[08/07/2012 15:21:44] other: That is a mean thing to say XD I shouldn't say that.
[08/07/2012 15:21:45] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:21:45] other: Hahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:21:53] other: I don't think they would call you ugly.
[08/07/2012 15:21:57] other: Unless it is because they are jealous.
[08/07/2012 15:22:02] other: Which many would be XD
[08/07/2012 15:22:06] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:22:15] me: nice to know I'll be the most hated one soon
[08/07/2012 15:22:24] other: Unfortunately because I made it clear I was single now there are a fair few people who have shown an interest XD
[08/07/2012 15:22:26] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 15:22:31] other: Maybe not all will hate you - they will just be jealous.
[08/07/2012 15:22:37] other: ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:22:50] other: I don't know, people are competitive ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:22:54] me: :) I hope so... I'm young to die
[08/07/2012 15:23:11] other: Haha well luckily there are not too many devs in Spain who fancy me so you may be safe :D
[08/07/2012 15:23:22] other: By the way, have you met with Rodrigo before? RSCDev?
[08/07/2012 15:23:33] me: rodrigo? he's from brazil
[08/07/2012 15:23:39] other: Oh right, sorry :D
[08/07/2012 15:23:46] other: I am forgetful - I DID know that.
[08/07/2012 15:23:48] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:23:50] other: I forgot XD
[08/07/2012 15:24:01] me: i just went out to buy beer and met him
[08/07/2012 15:24:02] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:24:05] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:24:22] other: So what about Javier?
[08/07/2012 15:24:24] other: Where is he from?
[08/07/2012 15:24:35] me: javier lives a little far at south
[08/07/2012 15:24:45] me: never met him but we are close
[08/07/2012 15:24:48] other: So you have not met him either?
[08/07/2012 15:24:56] other: Have you met any Corona devs there thne?
[08/07/2012 15:24:58] other: then*
[08/07/2012 15:25:04] me: hahahaha no
[08/07/2012 15:25:10] other: Well then you are probably quite safe :D
[08/07/2012 15:25:33] me: hope so...
[08/07/2012 15:25:52] me: can we talk a little more privately now or there are flies around?
[08/07/2012 15:25:54] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:26:12] other: We should do an interview or something when I'm there for Techority, hahahaha. That could be fun.
[08/07/2012 15:26:16] other: For now I have privacy :)
[08/07/2012 15:26:23] me: oh god
[08/07/2012 15:26:32] me: me interviewing you or viceversa?
[08/07/2012 15:26:33] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:26:47] other: Not for a call-call, but for typing enough privacy. Which I think is what you meant?
[08/07/2012 15:26:52] other: Hah I thought me interviewing you.
[08/07/2012 15:26:55] other: Although we could do either.
[08/07/2012 15:27:01] other: We could interview each other even XD
[08/07/2012 15:27:06] me: what would you ask me?
[08/07/2012 15:27:07] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:27:28] other: I don't know - you made ChocoRun so I could ask about that, about your plans for the future with different SDKs - normal serious stuff - but then funny things too.
[08/07/2012 15:27:38] other: Like "How does it feel to have other on your couch?"
[08/07/2012 15:27:40] other: XD
[08/07/2012 15:28:00] me: I could answer something problematic...
[08/07/2012 15:28:11] me: a little worse than have her on the bed, but ok enough
[08/07/2012 15:28:12] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:28:18] other: Hahahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:28:29] other: If you wanted. Though then people really might go after you XD
[08/07/2012 15:28:37] me: hahahaha
[08/07/2012 15:28:40] me: I'm dead
[08/07/2012 15:28:44] other: Hahahaha
[08/07/2012 15:28:45] me: and i don't care a bit
[08/07/2012 15:28:48] me: :D
[08/07/2012 15:28:57] other: At least Carlos isn't my actual father and only like a father in many ways XD
[08/07/2012 15:29:04] other: If he were I think it would be his job to kill you then :D
[08/07/2012 15:29:12] me: ooops
[08/07/2012 15:29:20] me: so I have to worry about your real father?
[08/07/2012 15:29:26] other: Hah, no. XD
[08/07/2012 15:29:33] other: My real father I have almost nothing to do with.
[08/07/2012 15:29:42] other: I wont even tell him I am leaving the country unless I get stuck talking to him.
[08/07/2012 15:29:51] other: We only speak like twice a year. He's an asshole.
[08/07/2012 15:29:57] other: Did I tell you about how he wanted me to pay him to help me move?
[08/07/2012 15:30:02] me: yeah
[08/07/2012 15:30:05] other: Yeah.
[08/07/2012 15:30:06] me: but the thing stayed there
[08/07/2012 15:30:10] other: That was the last time we spoke.
[08/07/2012 15:30:20] other: He hasn't called me once since I got here.
[08/07/2012 15:30:25] me: so he never called you to know how the move went...
[08/07/2012 15:30:26] other: He hasn't checked how I am, nothing like that.
[08/07/2012 15:30:30] other: No.
[08/07/2012 15:30:34] me: shit
[08/07/2012 15:30:40] other: I am not surprised at all.
[08/07/2012 15:30:54] other: But I will not speak to him now until probably my birthday when he may call out of obligation.
[08/07/2012 15:31:08] me: well ok...
[08/07/2012 15:31:15] other: So no, you don't have to worry about him XD
[08/07/2012 15:31:19] other: My joke w
[08/07/2012 15:31:20] me: but let's talk about something else
[08/07/2012 15:31:22] other: oops
[08/07/2012 15:31:25] other: Hit enter too soon XD
[08/07/2012 15:31:40] other: My joke was that it is good Carlos isn't my father, and is only like a father.
[08/07/2012 15:31:43] other: Not that my father would be like that.
[08/07/2012 15:31:48] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:31:48] other: He wouldn't care :)
[08/07/2012 15:31:50] me: ok
[08/07/2012 15:31:54] other: (That isn't a sad thing so you know.)
[08/07/2012 15:31:56] other: :)
[08/07/2012 15:32:07] other: But yes we can talk about something else, haha. I just wanted to clarify it wasn't a problem :)
[08/07/2012 15:32:11] me: but i think Carlos would act weird for some time
[08/07/2012 15:32:17] other: Hah, do you?
[08/07/2012 15:32:25] other: Why?
[08/07/2012 15:32:34] me: oh his little peach...
[08/07/2012 15:32:35] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:32:40] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:32:56] other: I wont be so innocent to him any more XD
[08/07/2012 15:33:09] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:33:13] me: no worries
[08/07/2012 15:33:16] other: Though I suspect he knows I am not that innocent anyway ^-^; He can probably guess that. I don't know.
[08/07/2012 15:33:16] other: Haha.
[08/07/2012 15:33:21] me: Peachy...
[08/07/2012 15:33:28] other: Caballero :)
[08/07/2012 15:33:34] me: I've been watching porn the whole day
[08/07/2012 15:33:40] other: Hahahaha XD
[08/07/2012 15:33:46] me: sorry
[08/07/2012 15:33:46] other: That is a lot of porn!
[08/07/2012 15:33:51] other: It's OK :D
[08/07/2012 15:33:57] other: I just thought it sounded funny, to read that.
[08/07/2012 15:34:01] other: It was unexpected.
[08/07/2012 15:34:03] me: i didn't touch me a bit
[08/07/2012 15:34:19] me: and i've been about to explode
[08/07/2012 15:34:33] me: but
[08/07/2012 15:34:39] other: Heh ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:34:39] me: i got some conslusions
[08/07/2012 15:34:42] me: conclusions
[08/07/2012 15:34:49] other: What conclusions did you get?
[08/07/2012 15:35:05] me: yesterday you really turned me on bad peachy...
[08/07/2012 15:35:07] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:35:10] other: Hahahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:35:18] other: Well at least it didn't scare you off.
[08/07/2012 15:35:21] other: It freaks some people out a little bit.
[08/07/2012 15:35:28] me: but i still thought that could be a little sad to do
[08/07/2012 15:35:37] me: for me of course
[08/07/2012 15:35:45] other: What would be sad, sorry?
[08/07/2012 15:35:52] me: acting... rough
[08/07/2012 15:35:56] other: Heh
[08/07/2012 15:36:10] me: so i've been reading and watching
[08/07/2012 15:36:15] other: Don't worry about that. If it works and it feels OK, good, if it doesn't or it makes you sad I wouldn't push you with it.
[08/07/2012 15:36:20] me: and i can only say i was wrong
[08/07/2012 15:36:25] other: Hahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:36:28] other: Well that's good to hear :D
[08/07/2012 15:37:11] me: i like it, who wouldn't? dominating or how you call it, being the one who leads, whatever
[08/07/2012 15:37:28] me: i just thougt it was something not so right to do
[08/07/2012 15:37:32] other: Yes, "dominating" is what most people call it ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:37:35] me: but shit
[08/07/2012 15:37:42] me: if the girl likes it
[08/07/2012 15:37:49] me: that can't be bad
[08/07/2012 15:37:50] other: Heh, exactly ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:37:53] other: :D
[08/07/2012 15:38:13] me: so now i'm going to ask you something really weird
[08/07/2012 15:38:20] other: I figure even if you were nervous etc that when you start and the other person likes it, yeah, it gets easier.
[08/07/2012 15:38:20] me: well before that
[08/07/2012 15:38:25] other: Hah, yes? ^-^;
[08/07/2012 15:38:39] me: i'm not gosh this is hard...
[08/07/2012 15:38:46] me: let me have a sec
[08/07/2012 15:38:50] other: Take your time.
[08/07/2012 15:38:52] other: :)
[08/07/2012 15:39:15] me: it's wrong, or at least i think it's a little wrong to ask a girl what she likes rather than figuring out
[08/07/2012 15:39:27] me: so that's not what i am asking
[08/07/2012 15:39:36] me: i really want to discover on my own ;)
[08/07/2012 15:39:40] me: but
[08/07/2012 15:39:46] other: Well, you could ask that if you ever want to - but yes, that is fine too.
[08/07/2012 15:39:48] other: :)
[08/07/2012 15:39:58] me: what if we watch porn together and you gave me your impressions?
[08/07/2012 15:40:12] me: give me, sorry
[08/07/2012 15:40:17] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:40:22] me: yeah i know it's weird
[08/07/2012 15:40:27] other: No, it's cool.
[08/07/2012 15:40:39] other: We can do that sometime, though it must be when I have privacy XD
[08/07/2012 15:40:52] me: i was about to send you a link
[08/07/2012 15:40:53] other: It I can watch it on a phone it's easier, if it's on a computer I have to be careful ;)
[08/07/2012 15:41:03] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:41:03] other: Heh well now isn't the best time - later tonight possibly.
[08/07/2012 15:41:09] other: Depends on when my mother goes to bed XD
[08/07/2012 15:41:16] other: They sometimes walk through this room you see.
[08/07/2012 15:41:19] other: And with my huge screen :D
[08/07/2012 15:41:23] me: as you wish....
[08/07/2012 15:41:24] other: It would be too obvious.
[08/07/2012 15:41:25] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:41:36] other: Hahahaha with my luck it would like, freeze on the screen or something.
[08/07/2012 15:41:36] me: don't put it fullscreen you fool!
[08/07/2012 15:41:37] other: :D
[08/07/2012 15:41:40] other: Hahahahaha
[08/07/2012 15:41:54] other: At the very least I have to finish my work before that XD
[08/07/2012 15:42:01] me: ok
[08/07/2012 15:42:04] other: I stopped to talk to you more ^-^;

[08/07/2012 15:42:07] other: I do that a lot ;)
[08/07/2012 15:42:20] other: Is it a download or is it on a website to watch?
[08/07/2012 15:42:25] me: website
[08/07/2012 15:42:33] me: after watching so much
[08/07/2012 15:42:51] me: i found something that i would like to know if it's too soft, too hard, just perfect...
[08/07/2012 15:43:00] me: just that
[08/07/2012 15:43:04] other: That is fair enough :)
[08/07/2012 15:43:16] me: :)
[08/07/2012 15:43:26] me: i'm a total nerd now you can say it
[08/07/2012 15:43:43] me: I even study porn
[08/07/2012 15:43:45] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:43:48] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 15:43:54] other: There are much worse things to study ;)
[08/07/2012 15:44:24] me: but really if we are at that point and i can't please you well...
[08/07/2012 15:44:30] me: i'd hate me so much
[08/07/2012 15:44:46] other: That is a very sad thought, and something you would not have to worry about.
[08/07/2012 15:44:57] other: I enjoy "normal" sex too - this is just a preference.
[08/07/2012 15:44:58] me: no it's not sad
[08/07/2012 15:45:05] other: But I am sure I would enjoy *both* plenty.
[08/07/2012 15:45:08] me: i know i can do it perfectly for you
[08/07/2012 15:45:12] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:45:18] other: I think it is great you want to do it perfectly but don't stress :)
[08/07/2012 15:45:20] me: i just don't want to wait
[08/07/2012 15:45:26] me: and make it right at first
[08/07/2012 15:45:28] me: xD
[08/07/2012 15:45:30] other: If we are at that point and it doesn't go 100% perfect we just have to practice ;)
[08/07/2012 15:45:32] other: That isn't so bad, right? :D
[08/07/2012 15:45:41] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 15:45:44] me: not at all
[08/07/2012 15:45:52] me: even practise or perfecting it

[08/07/2012 18:02:05] me: or too soft for what you want?
[08/07/2012 18:02:07] me: :D
[08/07/2012 18:02:19] other: I have only watched a little and will be watching more now, though we wont type while I do due to sound+headphones.
[08/07/2012 18:02:27] other: Skype sound will interrupt video which is on pause ;)
[08/07/2012 18:02:34] other: So give me a few minutes, OK? :)
[08/07/2012 18:02:37] me: ok
[08/07/2012 18:02:44] other: Thanks :)
[08/07/2012 18:12:12] other: Heh, that was overall a very good video - I skipped bits because otherwise would have taken 24 minutes ;)
[08/07/2012 18:12:17] other: But I saw all major parts.
[08/07/2012 18:12:27] other: Foot thing I don't get either - that isn't my kind of thing.
[08/07/2012 18:12:32] other: They must have a foot fetish XD
[08/07/2012 18:12:54] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 18:12:59] other: I'm also less into, uhm, ass stuff than they seemed to be XD
[08/07/2012 18:13:01] me: the end i don't quite like it
[08/07/2012 18:13:19] other: I'm not opposed to it but it isn't yes, not quite like they were.
[08/07/2012 18:13:34] me: but the style...
[08/07/2012 18:13:39] other: What they did too, anything ass related then oral stuff, not interested in for obvious reasons - just so you know ;)
[08/07/2012 18:13:40] other: But yes.
[08/07/2012 18:13:49] other: The style was good - I can like a bit rougher but overall, very good.
[08/07/2012 18:13:50] other: :)
[08/07/2012 18:13:54] other: I enjoyed the video :)
[08/07/2012 18:14:02] me: oh yeah i don't think this is rough
[08/07/2012 18:14:19] me: it's just slightly more interesting
[08/07/2012 18:14:20] me: xD
[08/07/2012 18:14:31] me: than standards of course
[08/07/2012 18:14:56] me: those red things you are hanging on

[08/07/2012 18:15:18] other: Ah that - that's a sex swing XD I don't have it here am afraid - we could get one online though ;)
[08/07/2012 18:15:27] me: why waiting
[08/07/2012 18:15:33] me: i'll go to a shop don't worry
[08/07/2012 18:15:50] other: Hah, we will plan for it.

[08/07/2012 18:16:26] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 18:16:35] other: It's a very interesting and fun way of having sex, IMHO.
[08/07/2012 18:16:43] me: and for what you said, we are almost in the same point
[08/07/2012 18:16:59] me: a really like it a bit rougher than that
[08/07/2012 18:17:05] me: i do like dominating
[08/07/2012 18:17:23] me: and the only thing left is telling you names xD but as you wish
[08/07/2012 18:17:44] other: Heh, the name calling thing you will see is not so bad, and it isn't a big part of it anyway.
[08/07/2012 18:17:53] other: The odd "bitch" tends to be enough ;)
[08/07/2012 18:17:59] other: But yes, haha, you get what I mean I think.
[08/07/2012 18:18:10] me: welll

[08/07/2012 18:19:54] other: I'm trying to discourage stalkers ;)
[08/07/2012 18:20:01] me: I adore how your hair comes over your head so disordered but nice

[08/07/2012 18:51:56] other: I did but haven't used it in a LONG time.

[08/07/2012 18:52:14] me: xD
[08/07/2012 18:52:19] other: These days I haven't been watching videos so often, I more tend to read fan fiction stuff.
[08/07/2012 18:52:23] other: Hah
[08/07/2012 18:52:41] me: I'd like to read some of those
[08/07/2012 18:52:44] me: :)
[08/07/2012 18:53:02] other: Have you seen the Harry Potter movies or read the books? ^-^;
[08/07/2012 18:53:07] me: nope
[08/07/2012 18:53:17] other: Ah I see ^-^; Well a lot of the fanfic I read is based on that XD
[08/07/2012 18:53:25] me: nevermind
[08/07/2012 18:53:33] me: I can read them anyway ;)
[08/07/2012 18:53:58] other: True. I read the ones on fanfic. uhm, I can't remember if it's "com" or "net".
[08/07/2012 18:54:18] other: But I read the rougher ones between Snape and Hermione - if you feel like looking that up sometime XD
[08/07/2012 18:54:34] other: I was always annoyed they never hooked up in the movies :D
[08/07/2012 18:54:36] me: can you send me a link?
[08/07/2012 18:55:00] other: I don't have one to a specific story, I should try to find one. I might try in a minute :)
[08/07/2012 18:55:06] me: ok
[08/07/2012 18:55:35] me: so that scene in watchmen where the comediant takes on the mother of one of the main characters...
[08/07/2012 18:55:41] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 18:55:47] other: Hahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 18:55:51] other: Yeah, I liked that scene.
[08/07/2012 18:55:52] other: XD
[08/07/2012 18:56:02] other: That's a good movie, too - but yeah, good scene XD
[08/07/2012 18:57:36] me: i want to say something but dont know quite how
[08/07/2012 18:57:58] other: I don't know what you want to say so can't help you say it unfortunately XD
[08/07/2012 18:58:16] me: if we get to that point and happily enjoy it, as it will be
[08/07/2012 18:58:29] me: i hope i don't get too bossy then
[08/07/2012 18:58:39] me: please tell me if i do
[08/07/2012 18:58:50] me: after sex i mean
[08/07/2012 18:59:04] other: Hah, outside of sex I tend to be the bossy one ^-^;
[08/07/2012 18:59:13] me: good xD
[08/07/2012 18:59:16] other: Don't worry, I don't let anyone boss me around outside of yes, sex :D
[08/07/2012 18:59:19] other: You know me :D
[08/07/2012 18:59:36] me: just so you tell me if i get to do something wrong
[08/07/2012 18:59:47] me: wich i don't think i will
[08/07/2012 18:59:51] me: but just in case
[08/07/2012 18:59:58] other: Don't worry, I'd tell you, I'd be nice about it but yes - don't worry :)
[08/07/2012 19:00:06] me: :*
[08/07/2012 19:00:08] other: With sex too, do you know what a "safe word" is?
[08/07/2012 19:00:17] me: well no
[08/07/2012 19:00:30] other: OK, well, what it is is a word that people use during this kind of sex.
[08/07/2012 19:00:37] other: If they feel like stopping, or taking a break, etc.
[08/07/2012 19:00:46] other: There is a random word they pick and either person can say it.
[08/07/2012 19:00:58] me: got it
[08/07/2012 19:01:10] other: The reason people use a safe word is because if you are playing around one person might be acting like they aren't that into it or whatever, kind of as a part of the game XD
[08/07/2012 19:01:16] me: as you want to get more when you say no
[08/07/2012 19:01:19] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:01:21] other: So that way you know the other person is into it because you have a word.
[08/07/2012 19:01:23] other: HAhaha
[08/07/2012 19:01:24] other: Yes XD
[08/07/2012 19:01:26] other: Exactly :D
[08/07/2012 19:01:36] me: so you say mushroom!
[08/07/2012 19:01:37] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:01:46] other: Haha, OK, "mushroom" it is ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:01:51] other: Makes me think of Mario of course.
[08/07/2012 19:01:57] me: oh no it could be whatever
[08/07/2012 19:02:12] me: maybe we have to agree on many
[08/07/2012 19:02:13] other: Mushroom is a fine word ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:02:16] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 19:02:26] other: Maybe, but mushroom is OK by me.
[08/07/2012 19:02:34] me: what if you want it harder and don't want to tell me?
[08/07/2012 19:02:37] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:02:48] other: This video is shorter but interesting - less pornographic but more erotic...
[08/07/2012 19:02:59] me: ok, send me
[08/07/2012 19:03:02] other: Well, resisting/saying no would be my way of doing that XD
[08/07/2012 19:03:07] me: ok xD
[08/07/2012 19:03:18] other: It's not rougher than the other and I didn't finish it but it's quite good.
[08/07/2012 19:03:19] other: http://www.redtube.com/158120
[08/07/2012 19:03:37] other: It's artistic XD
[08/07/2012 19:03:42] me: it is
[08/07/2012 19:04:24] me: have you ever tried to spank a cat?
[08/07/2012 19:04:29] me: just came to my mind
[08/07/2012 19:04:29] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:04:31] me: sorry
[08/07/2012 19:04:35] other: XD a CAT? XD
[08/07/2012 19:04:50] me: if you spank a cat from both sides it likes it a lot
[08/07/2012 19:04:55] me: try it with yours
[08/07/2012 19:04:59] other: Hahahahahaha :D
[08/07/2012 19:05:07] other: At first I was trying to work out if this was a language thing.
[08/07/2012 19:05:16] me: it will get the tail all up
[08/07/2012 19:05:20] other: Because of the word "pussy" which can mean more than one thing.
[08/07/2012 19:05:22] other: :D
[08/07/2012 19:05:26] me: yeah
[08/07/2012 19:05:29] other: I was trying to work out if you really meant cat or not :D
[08/07/2012 19:05:33] me: but in spanish we say conejo...
[08/07/2012 19:05:39] me: wich will be bunny
[08/07/2012 19:05:40] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:05:47] other: Haha, that's funny. XD
[08/07/2012 19:06:26] me: so you see yourself making that video?
[08/07/2012 19:06:56] other: Hah, possibly ^-^; It's still not as rough but it's good, shows how erotic it is.
[08/07/2012 19:07:04] other: And her position over his leg at first is good.
[08/07/2012 19:07:13] other: It's intimate but uh, convenient XD
[08/07/2012 19:07:20] me: :)
[08/07/2012 19:07:40] other: Lol in one of these videos girl was wearing INSANE shoes.
[08/07/2012 19:07:45] other: Like 30cm high.
[08/07/2012 19:07:49] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:07:49] other: INSANE.
[08/07/2012 19:07:53] other: They were platform things
[08/07/2012 19:07:57] other: Not heels.
[08/07/2012 19:07:58] other: XD
[08/07/2012 19:08:25] me: can i ask you a dirty one?
[08/07/2012 19:08:27] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:08:38] other: Hah, yes? XD
[08/07/2012 19:08:49] me: do you like getting it on your face?
[08/07/2012 19:09:00] other: Hah, well, it depends.
[08/07/2012 19:09:12] other: If it's late at night and drinking is going on, no :P
[08/07/2012 19:09:20] other: Because cleaning up thoroughly can be hard XD
[08/07/2012 19:09:27] other: But generally it's fine, yes :D
[08/07/2012 19:09:32] other: I just know am a lazy drunk at times ;)
[08/07/2012 19:09:36] me: hehe ok
[08/07/2012 19:09:43] other: And you don't want to snuggle into bed without being clean :D
[08/07/2012 19:09:55] me: maybe not xD
[08/07/2012 19:10:09] other: After rough sex snuggling is always good.
[08/07/2012 19:10:24] me: i think so

[08/07/2012 19:10:56] other: I don't know most people who do that ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:11:14] me: look im weird in many things
[08/07/2012 19:11:18] me: and sex is just one of them
[08/07/2012 19:11:28] me: i live for making the other person pleased
[08/07/2012 19:11:32] me: that's all
[08/07/2012 19:12:01] me: i may have some things i would like to try or so but what really turns me on is watching the other enjoying
[08/07/2012 19:12:08] other: Heh, I used to be like that - and could very well be again. I haven't been in a proper relationship in a long time, but definitely like making the other person happy :)
[08/07/2012 19:12:26] other: What kind of things are you interested in trying?
[08/07/2012 19:12:41] other: I take it "watching the other enjoying" you mean watching the other person getting off, right? ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:12:47] me: right
[08/07/2012 19:12:57] other: Yeah, I think that's fine ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:13:02] other: That's a fairly easy one to do, haha.
[08/07/2012 19:13:11] me: hahaha
[08/07/2012 19:13:37] other: Do you have other things you're interested in as well that you want to try? (Just curious.)
[08/07/2012 19:13:39] me: my last relationships have been a shit
[08/07/2012 19:13:48] me: never enjoyed sex with them
[08/07/2012 19:13:55] me: the kind of carpet-women
[08/07/2012 19:14:11] other: (In english you'd normally say "been shit" just so you know)
[08/07/2012 19:14:22] me: they are plain and you have to do it all without even a sign of anything
[08/07/2012 19:14:30] other: I don't know that term, carpet-women I am afraid.
[08/07/2012 19:14:32] other: Oh I see.
[08/07/2012 19:14:37] me: I haven't chosed right I know
[08/07/2012 19:14:52] other: They seem not interested in sex and whatnot so much you mean?
[08/07/2012 19:15:02] other: If so we call that "prude" in English.
[08/07/2012 19:15:05] me: yeah, but there's nothing especial i want to try out, i just want to be myself
[08/07/2012 19:15:21] other: That's cool :)
[08/07/2012 19:15:22] me: i like being dirty a lot
[08/07/2012 19:15:32] other: Haha, when I am happy I have quite a high sex drive.
[08/07/2012 19:15:32] me: but really only experienced with a single girl
[08/07/2012 19:15:40] other: Was that a long relationship?
[08/07/2012 19:15:48] me: not so much
[08/07/2012 19:15:50] me: 2 years
[08/07/2012 19:16:00] other: Was that your longest relationship?
[08/07/2012 19:16:04] me: I'm mostly not interested in girls
[08/07/2012 19:16:07] me: this one was
[08/07/2012 19:16:19] other: Hah, you're mostly not interested in girls? ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:16:23] me: the kind of girls i mostly know at least
[08/07/2012 19:16:41] me: i really don't want to fuck with someone i can't talk with
[08/07/2012 19:16:51] other: Yeah, I understand that.
[08/07/2012 19:17:19] me: you may think it's sad
[08/07/2012 19:17:29] me: my take is that i'm picky
[08/07/2012 19:17:30] me: xD
[08/07/2012 19:17:32] other: I may have to look at fan fiction tomorrow, having trouble finding a good one easily and I'm afraid that I should go to bed, it's fairly late.
[08/07/2012 19:17:35] other: Haha
[08/07/2012 19:17:47] other: I don't think it's sad so much.
[08/07/2012 19:17:50] other: I understand it :)
[08/07/2012 19:17:59] other: I don't have a great interest in guys I can't talk to either XD
[08/07/2012 19:18:11] me: :)
[08/07/2012 19:18:28] me: in many ways i think my mind works as a girl one xD
[08/07/2012 19:18:40] other: I think in many ways my mind works as a guys one XD
[08/07/2012 19:18:43] me: not on every way
[08/07/2012 19:18:48] me: but many
[08/07/2012 19:18:55] other: I understand that ^-^;
[08/07/2012 19:19:08] me: as a girls one i said
[08/07/2012 19:19:16] me: sorry to misspell that
[08/07/2012 19:19:26] other: I knew what you meant and it was a typo :)
[08/07/2012 19:19:29] me: now you won't understand that too much
[08/07/2012 19:19:36] me: oh great

[08/07/2012 19:20:03] other: Like I said I speak Carlos English.
[08/07/2012 19:20:08] other: Very confusing.
[08/07/2012 19:20:09] other: And that is a very hard language.

[08/07/2012 19:20:52] me: I hope you don't get to think i'm too romantic...
[08/07/2012 19:20:55] me: cos i am a lot
[08/07/2012 19:21:05] other: I think romance is good too :)
[08/07/2012 19:21:19] other: Just because I like that kind of sex doesn't mean I'm not "normal" in other ways, haha :D
[08/07/2012 19:21:31] other: It's good to show love and romance is one way of doing that.
[08/07/2012 19:21:36] me: that kind of sex doesn't make you unnormal in any way
[08/07/2012 19:21:52] me: it's just that, a kind of sex
[08/07/2012 19:22:00] other: Some people actually think it's bad XD
[08/07/2012 19:22:09] other: I know it's not but it's not the most common.
[08/07/2012 19:22:13] me: and i can greatly enjoy a girl that wants me to rule her hahaha

[09/07/2012 6:20:38] me: so yes, today we can talk
[09/07/2012 6:20:43] other: I just saw email about that, haven't watched yet due to phone
[09/07/2012 6:20:43] me: and you can see me
[09/07/2012 6:21:03] other: (typing one handed as phone has no speaker)
[09/07/2012 6:21:09] me: :D
[09/07/2012 6:21:54] me: just by curiosity, what are you talking about with the gov?
[09/07/2012 6:27:56] other: give me minute am talking to them now, will explain when back
[09/07/2012 6:29:40] me: ok
[09/07/2012 6:40:35] other: Back
[09/07/2012 6:40:41] other: Sorry, got interrupted again by another call.
[09/07/2012 6:40:49] other: I did get to watch video - that was lovely, thank you :)
[09/07/2012 6:40:59] other: I really enjoyed it :)
[09/07/2012 6:41:13] me: oops sorry
[09/07/2012 6:41:17] me: i was shaving
[09/07/2012 6:41:25] other: I think it's good you reread chats but also make sure to clear them after, OK? :)
[09/07/2012 6:41:29] other: Oh sorry, haha :D
[09/07/2012 6:41:32] other: Don't cut yourself!
[09/07/2012 6:41:37] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 6:41:44] me: no don't worry it's done now
[09/07/2012 6:41:54] other: Oh good ^-^; I thought I was interrupting.
[09/07/2012 6:41:57] me: clear our chats?
[09/07/2012 6:42:00] me: hmmm
[09/07/2012 6:42:03] other: I liked the video very much, thank you. :)
[09/07/2012 6:42:03] other: Yes XD
[09/07/2012 6:42:06] me: I have a problem with that
[09/07/2012 6:42:10] other: You must clear them XD
[09/07/2012 6:42:11] me: xD
[09/07/2012 6:42:22] other: I know you don't want to ^-^;
[09/07/2012 6:42:32] other: But it's not a good idea to keep logs of many of our talks.
[09/07/2012 6:42:40] me: :)
[09/07/2012 6:42:52] me: I'm not so full of good ideas (devil)
[09/07/2012 6:42:57] other: The content of them, if ever found, would be no good. You know, we talk about a lot of things, so it's not that safe XD
[09/07/2012 6:43:05] other: Hah
[09/07/2012 6:43:19] me: ok I'll clean them out...
[09/07/2012 6:43:22] other: Well I am sure you are - but please, you must clear chats. They have too much private stuff in them.
[09/07/2012 6:43:24] me: but i hate to
[09/07/2012 6:43:28] other: Sorry, I know.
[09/07/2012 6:43:30] other: I don't like clearing them either.
[09/07/2012 6:43:41] other: I am just used to it by now because I am so security conscious.
[09/07/2012 6:43:56] other: Sorry :(
[09/07/2012 6:44:09] me: i really don't care about anyone finding my things
[09/07/2012 6:44:13] me: but i'll do it for you
[09/07/2012 6:44:24] other: Thank you - I wouldn't want others reading my things :D
[09/07/2012 6:44:38] other: I am quite private, so I tell you, but I wouldn't want anyone else reading them.
[09/07/2012 6:44:51] me: ok, no worries
[09/07/2012 6:44:59] me: from now on this skype will be clean
[09/07/2012 6:45:03] me: ;)
[09/07/2012 6:45:09] other: Now, I said I'd explain about the government - basically when I get paid by Apple I have to report it to this part of the government.
[09/07/2012 6:45:15] other: Good, thank you very much :)
[09/07/2012 6:45:23] other: I have to do that because I have a card from the government.
[09/07/2012 6:45:30] other: And the card is used to make medicine a little bit cheaper.
[09/07/2012 6:45:41] me: oh i get it
[09/07/2012 6:45:42] other: But part of it is that they have to know when I make money.
[09/07/2012 6:45:47] other: Which is really irritating XD
[09/07/2012 6:46:00] other: They also get to decide how long I can stay outisde the country for - also very annoying.
[09/07/2012 6:46:14] me: ...
[09/07/2012 6:46:26] me: so what they are going to do? come here and kidnap you?
[09/07/2012 6:46:38] me: xD
[09/07/2012 6:46:39] other: Hahaha no, they'd just cut off the card and make me pay them some money.
[09/07/2012 6:46:57] other: It's a weird system in Australia XD
[09/07/2012 6:47:12] me: that wouldn't be a problem with my pay ;)
[09/07/2012 6:47:30] other: Hah well I'm also not sure that I can live in Spain forever :D For multiple reasons.
[09/07/2012 6:47:37] other: 1) I'd get kicked out eventually because there are limits
[09/07/2012 6:47:39] other: and
[09/07/2012 6:47:47] other: 2) I have to try and get into America you know.
[09/07/2012 6:47:49] other: XD
[09/07/2012 6:47:56] me: ^_^
[09/07/2012 6:48:01] me: and I'll go with you
[09/07/2012 6:48:07] other: I want to be where all the action is for tech ^-^;
[09/07/2012 6:48:11] other: If we can find a way in :D
[09/07/2012 6:48:15] other: America is hard to get in to.
[09/07/2012 6:48:17] other: I mean, to live.
[09/07/2012 6:48:23] other: To visit it is not hard.
[09/07/2012 6:48:32] me: easy
[09/07/2012 6:48:38] other: Your English was good on the video by the way :)

[09/07/2012 6:51:26] other: That's fine, I make asian/chinese jokes about him too.

[09/07/2012 7:03:34] other: Right now I'm converting music for my mother's mp3 player - it is a slow process XD
[09/07/2012 7:03:34] other: Haha :D

[09/07/2012 7:03:37] me: xD

[09/07/2012 7:05:22] me: HEY!
[09/07/2012 7:05:27] me: what if?
[09/07/2012 7:05:36] me: let's make those apps in moai!!!
[09/07/2012 7:05:56] other: Not the ones she wrote - but - I think making a new one in Moai is a good idea.
[09/07/2012 7:06:09] other: I would write it though, so it was something just US did.
[09/07/2012 7:06:14] other: Rather than one she wrote.
[09/07/2012 7:06:22] me: :)
[09/07/2012 7:06:29] me: ok, no threesome
[09/07/2012 7:06:29] other: Only because she doesn't understand any SDK stuff so wouldn't appreciate what it meant to make it Moai :D
[09/07/2012 7:06:32] other: Haha
[09/07/2012 7:06:40] other: I hope I made sense XD
[09/07/2012 7:06:44] other: But yes, no "threesome" :D

[09/07/2012 7:07:22] me: wow

[09/07/2012 7:13:06] me: I'll keep poking him ;)
[09/07/2012 7:13:27] me: as more test apps are made by us and maybe some final ones, he'll easily get into the mood
[09/07/2012 7:13:41] other: I think so too :)
[09/07/2012 7:13:53] other: It is so cold today, I don't know why.
[09/07/2012 7:13:56] other: I am wearing my scarf ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:14:01] me: ^_^

[09/07/2012 7:15:14] other: But then was just too tired and had to fall asleep XD
[09/07/2012 7:15:19] other: ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:15:24] other: I had to rush which felt a bit rude.
[09/07/2012 7:15:35] me: no worries
[09/07/2012 7:15:42] me: I'll just hate you forever for it
[09/07/2012 7:15:57] me: don't you noticed my infuriated eyes in the video? xD

[09/07/2012 7:17:53] other: If I visit there it wont interfere with any plans we make for later in the year, just so you know. Would be before then.
[09/07/2012 7:17:58] me: I've changed my lock screen
[09/07/2012 7:18:01] other: Yeah?
[09/07/2012 7:18:16] me: oh so you are visiting others before?
[09/07/2012 7:18:22] me: hmmm
[09/07/2012 7:18:27] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:18:29] other: I might, I haven't decided yet.
[09/07/2012 7:18:39] other: A friend and his daughter I may see XD
[09/07/2012 7:18:58] me: ok ok...
[09/07/2012 7:19:09] other: Because I may plan on visiting the US first anyway, before visiting you.
[09/07/2012 7:19:14] me: just don't forget to talk with me a little too or i'll be madly jealous
[09/07/2012 7:19:21] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:19:26] other: Because IF I go there it will be my last chance to see my friends on the team all together before I end up leaving.
[09/07/2012 7:19:38] other: And I'd kind of like to do that one more time, although I may not, we will see.
[09/07/2012 7:19:39] other: Haha
[09/07/2012 7:19:55] other: I would have a phone, iMessage and some time on Skype - it wouldn't be that different, I'd just rest a bit more.
[09/07/2012 7:20:02] me: :)
[09/07/2012 7:20:05] me: nice then
[09/07/2012 7:20:22] me: and about being the last time to see the team
[09/07/2012 7:20:29] me: this world is not so big ;)
[09/07/2012 7:20:51] other: No but they wont all be together again I don't think.
[09/07/2012 7:20:59] other: Which is a shame.
[09/07/2012 7:21:15] other: Plus I don't know when I will get to live there and see them regularly either XD
[09/07/2012 7:21:15] me: i don't like to think like that
[09/07/2012 7:21:31] me: i like to think w wil get kicked off
[09/07/2012 7:21:43] other: I hope he does.
[09/07/2012 7:21:46] me: and then the team will join the rapanui crew
[09/07/2012 7:21:47] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:21:54] me: dreaming is free
[09/07/2012 7:22:12] other: It would be better if W got kicked off and replaced and Corona could go on.
[09/07/2012 7:22:21] other: They should fire W and offer Carlos lots and lots of money to come back.
[09/07/2012 7:22:22] other: XD
[09/07/2012 7:22:27] me: hahahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:22:46] me: yeah but I don't know if Carlos would come back
[09/07/2012 7:22:59] other: I doubt he would too, somehow.
[09/07/2012 7:23:15] me: anyway
[09/07/2012 7:23:23] me: we have lots of things on the table
[09/07/2012 7:23:29] other: That is true :)
[09/07/2012 7:23:31] me: moai apps
[09/07/2012 7:23:33] me: peach tv
[09/07/2012 7:23:36] me: and sex toys
[09/07/2012 7:23:38] me: :D
[09/07/2012 7:23:40] other: Hahahaha yes, Peach TV XD
[09/07/2012 7:23:41] other: HAH
[09/07/2012 7:23:43] other: And that, yes :D
[09/07/2012 7:24:05] me: so we have plenty to do and not worry about anything else yet ;)
[09/07/2012 7:24:16] other: Yes, I suppose so ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:24:32] me: maybe mixing the last two could be a HUGE hit
[09/07/2012 7:24:33] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:24:46] other: Hahahahaha :D
[09/07/2012 7:25:10] other: I am sure it would be, but that might be a bad idea - I already have enough stalkers XD
[09/07/2012 7:25:11] other: I would get more :D
[09/07/2012 7:25:16] me: true...
[09/07/2012 7:25:22] me: by the way...
[09/07/2012 7:25:43] me: I don't really want to talk about someone else that has a crush on you
[09/07/2012 7:25:45] me: but
[09/07/2012 7:25:56] me: you were good friends with Matt right?
[09/07/2012 7:26:03] other: Yes.
[09/07/2012 7:26:16] me: i think he may be very upset...
[09/07/2012 7:26:23] me: when we meet
[09/07/2012 7:26:41] other: I think he probably will be, but there isn't a lot that can be done about that.
[09/07/2012 7:26:50] me: true
[09/07/2012 7:26:56] other: I am still nice to him but there isn't any kind of spark there or anything.
[09/07/2012 7:27:03] me: and telling him your planning it is not good
[09/07/2012 7:27:10] other: He's a nice guy but we don't have much in common.
[09/07/2012 7:27:21] other: I don't plan to tell him I'm planning it I don't think.
[09/07/2012 7:27:27] me: ok
[09/07/2012 7:27:32] me: just wanted to know your take
[09/07/2012 7:27:38] other: I don't know if it will come up, even - we do not talk that much.
[09/07/2012 7:27:55] me: by his comment on your fb it seems like he could be noticing something
[09/07/2012 7:28:18] other: The main reason I spoke to him initially was because we talked about the possibility of green card marriage - but he likes me too much for that to work.
[09/07/2012 7:28:33] me: aha
[09/07/2012 7:28:40] other: (If I ever got a green card marriage it would be fake, not a real marriage, so with someone who was a friend, not more.)
[09/07/2012 7:28:46] other: And yeah, he liked me a bit much.
[09/07/2012 7:28:52] other: What comment on FB?
[09/07/2012 7:29:01] me: for the last video
[09/07/2012 7:29:06] me: "I want you"
[09/07/2012 7:29:27] me: I must say i went liking it so fast xD
[09/07/2012 7:29:43] me: hope that's not a problem
[09/07/2012 7:29:45] other: Hah, what is wrong with his comment? XD He says odd things sometimes.
[09/07/2012 7:29:46] other: No, that's fine.
[09/07/2012 7:29:54] other: It's a good song and OK clip :)
[09/07/2012 7:30:02] me: nice clip :D
[09/07/2012 7:30:09] other: ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:30:14] other: Regardless, do you know Matt?
[09/07/2012 7:30:20] me: not much
[09/07/2012 7:30:30] me: i know who he is and what he does a bit
[09/07/2012 7:30:32] me: just that
[09/07/2012 7:30:53] other: I just wondered :)
[09/07/2012 7:31:23] me: it's not a friend battle for the most beautiful girl ever dont worry
[09/07/2012 7:31:25] me: ;)
[09/07/2012 7:31:36] other: I think he will be OK with things eventually. It isn't like we are that close. He was never nice about my ex, either, he said some mean things that showed bad character.
[09/07/2012 7:31:38] other: Hahaha :D
[09/07/2012 7:31:41] other: :*
[09/07/2012 7:31:50] me: :*
[09/07/2012 7:31:59] me: that's not good at all...
[09/07/2012 7:32:19] me: if you chose him to be your partner there has to be something good about him :)
[09/07/2012 7:32:35] other: Yeah. He told me I should leave him and take him to a *homeless shelter* (because he knew he couldn't look after himself financially) >.<'
[09/07/2012 7:32:49] me: oh come on...
[09/07/2012 7:32:57] me: ok i can see you are not so close
[09/07/2012 7:32:59] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:33:03] other: Yeah XD
[09/07/2012 7:33:11] other: I was like, so sad when he said that the first time.
[09/07/2012 7:33:25] other: Like you are with someone for years and even if it doesn't work he thinks you just dump them at a shelter >.<'
[09/07/2012 7:33:33] other: It is a freaky way to think.
[09/07/2012 7:33:37] other: So heartless.
[09/07/2012 7:33:42] me: bad thought
[09/07/2012 7:33:47] me: take it out
[09/07/2012 7:33:57] other: Yeah, you know me, I am not like that ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:34:03] other: I like happy thoughts, haha.
[09/07/2012 7:34:05] me: of course not
[09/07/2012 7:34:12] me: you are a lovely peachy!
[09/07/2012 7:34:16] me: :*
[09/07/2012 7:34:22] other: Heh :* Thank you.
[09/07/2012 7:34:27] other: Now, I believe it might be your work time?
[09/07/2012 7:34:32] me: wrong!
[09/07/2012 7:34:34] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:34:37] me: I shaved before
[09/07/2012 7:34:42] me: have some more time
[09/07/2012 7:35:09] other: I see, what time do you have to go? I have to make another short call in a minute is all, which means going outside as this one is to a mobile.
[09/07/2012 7:35:20] me: in half an hour
[09/07/2012 7:35:28] other: (Earlier one I used the main phone but when you use a mobile here you have to go walk around outside, haha.)
[09/07/2012 7:35:38] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:35:40] other: Reception here (phone signal) is just awful. XD
[09/07/2012 7:35:54] me: good to keep phone stalkers away
[09/07/2012 7:36:05] other: I will brb, going to make that quick call, OK?
[09/07/2012 7:36:12] me: ok :*!!!
[09/07/2012 7:41:54] other: Back :)
[09/07/2012 7:42:04] me: nice it was fast :)
[09/07/2012 7:42:17] other: I grabbed a tiny bag of popcorn from the kitchen on my way back too :D
[09/07/2012 7:42:22] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:42:23] other: Yeah I just had to check on Dex.
[09/07/2012 7:42:33] me: that's cool
[09/07/2012 7:42:37] other: We're trying to maintain a friendship which means a quick call most days.
[09/07/2012 7:42:41] me: glad you ended up well
[09/07/2012 7:42:51] other: I have to call his mother later >.<' :D
[09/07/2012 7:42:56] me: what?
[09/07/2012 7:42:57] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:43:01] other: Hah
[09/07/2012 7:43:07] me: did you have a relationship too?
[09/07/2012 7:43:08] other: She misses me a lot, you see.
[09/07/2012 7:43:09] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:43:10] other: XD
[09/07/2012 7:43:16] other: She writes to me every day.
[09/07/2012 7:43:21] me: aw...
[09/07/2012 7:43:25] other: She thought of me like a daughter so it's hard for her.
[09/07/2012 7:43:30] me: i see
[09/07/2012 7:43:38] other: She is used to me being nearby because she lived next door to us in Sydney.
[09/07/2012 7:43:44] other: So she would see me very often.
[09/07/2012 7:44:14] me: well you can tell her her extended daughter is going to be so good very soon ;)
[09/07/2012 7:44:37] other: Hahaha yes well I can't tell her much right now XD She still hopes things will work out and I will be back there I think.
[09/07/2012 7:44:43] other: One day she will feel differently.
[09/07/2012 7:44:50] me: but hey i didn't finish telling you
[09/07/2012 7:44:53] other: When she sees Dex is OK and I am happy too :)
[09/07/2012 7:45:02] me: changed my lockscreen
[09/07/2012 7:45:07] other: Oh right, yes - sorry.
[09/07/2012 7:45:12] other: What did you change it to?
[09/07/2012 7:45:12] me: for one of your pics from last night
[09/07/2012 7:45:17] other: Oh hah, cool, which one?
[09/07/2012 7:45:38] me: the one you are looking up showing me those BIG BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES
[09/07/2012 7:45:46] other: Haha :)
[09/07/2012 7:45:50] other: Yes that is a nice picture :)
[09/07/2012 7:46:04] me: zoomed a bit just in case anyone grabs my phone though xD
[09/07/2012 7:46:16] other: Haha yeah well that is a good idea XD
[09/07/2012 7:46:29] other: It is far too "girly" of a picture :D
[09/07/2012 7:46:39] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:46:50] me: I loved all 3
[09/07/2012 7:46:52] other: Oh I felt fat today - a button popped off my pants XD
[09/07/2012 7:46:54] other: But
[09/07/2012 7:47:00] other: It wasn't because of my weight XD
[09/07/2012 7:47:04] me: HAHAHAHAH
[09/07/2012 7:47:11] other: It was because of how I was bending.
[09/07/2012 7:47:22] other: I did a weird thing with my leg to turn off this water thing.
[09/07/2012 7:47:26] other: Low on the ground.
[09/07/2012 7:47:31] me: you are not fat!
[09/07/2012 7:47:39] other: (Hard to explain, this house has some odd taps connected to other things.)
[09/07/2012 7:47:48] me: hmmm
[09/07/2012 7:47:49] other: Then a button popped off and I felt fat for a moment XD
[09/07/2012 7:47:51] other: Haha I know.
[09/07/2012 7:47:59] other: I just felt like it because of the button.
[09/07/2012 7:48:10] me: i don't get what taps you are talking about but it's ok
[09/07/2012 7:48:11] other: But it was just how I was bend and how I had my leg :D
[09/07/2012 7:48:15] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:48:16] other: It was quite funny.
[09/07/2012 7:48:28] me: although you are not fat you could get thinner here
[09/07/2012 7:48:29] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:48:33] other: I cannot explain it well, but don't worry, that part isn't important.
[09/07/2012 7:48:36] other: Hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:48:42] other: It would be more exercise, yes :D
[09/07/2012 7:48:51] me: i'm quite thin myself...
[09/07/2012 7:49:05] other: You look like you are a good weight I think :)
[09/07/2012 7:49:10] me: maybe a little like jon beebe xD
[09/07/2012 7:49:14] other: Hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:49:17] me: big head and thin
[09/07/2012 7:49:19] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:49:22] other: Yes Biffy worries he doesn't eat enough.
[09/07/2012 7:49:23] other: Lol :D
[09/07/2012 7:49:29] other: Your head fits your body just fine.
[09/07/2012 7:49:34] me: hope so
[09/07/2012 7:49:37] other: But yes, Jon never gains weight.
[09/07/2012 7:49:43] other: Biffy always tries to make him eat more.
[09/07/2012 7:49:46] me: hahahaha
[09/07/2012 7:49:58] other: It's quite funny ^-^;
[09/07/2012 7:50:07] other: She eats a normal amount but feels like she eats too much I think.
[09/07/2012 7:50:13] other: Because he doesn't eat much at all XD
[09/07/2012 7:50:21] me: poor Biffy
[09/07/2012 7:50:29] other: She is a nice girl :)
[09/07/2012 7:50:34] me: i know!
[09/07/2012 7:50:37] me: she's awesome
[09/07/2012 7:50:52] other: I haven't heard from her in a bit, I need to write to her again soon.
[09/07/2012 7:51:02] other: Last we emailed was like a month ago almost I think.
[09/07/2012 7:51:05] me: but i have something to tell her someday
[09/07/2012 7:51:08] me: she got me angry
[09/07/2012 7:51:11] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:51:14] other: Hahahaha - when? Why? :D
[09/07/2012 7:51:21] me: last year
[09/07/2012 7:51:33] me: i tried to catch her for your cake for almost 3 weeks
[09/07/2012 7:51:38] me: and never replied back
[09/07/2012 7:51:47] other: Oh that is a shame.
[09/07/2012 7:51:57] other: I think she is not so good sometimes at checking her mail XD
[09/07/2012 7:52:00] me: then she replied back one week later
[09/07/2012 7:52:05] me: :(
[09/07/2012 7:52:10] other: What did she say one week later?
[09/07/2012 7:52:25] me: she was so sorry but yeah... she missed it
[09/07/2012 7:52:37] me: and i didn't liked that a bit
[09/07/2012 7:52:38] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:52:40] other: Haha
[09/07/2012 7:52:49] other: Yeah, she unfortunately is not good with mail sometimes.
[09/07/2012 7:52:56] other: I often have to wait ages for a reply, too.
[09/07/2012 7:53:02] other: She used to be better but then got a bit slack :D
[09/07/2012 7:53:18] me: things about being a mother i think
[09/07/2012 7:53:26] other: Yes, probably.
[09/07/2012 7:53:35] other: I do not know that I ever want to be a mother I admit XD
[09/07/2012 7:53:47] me: neither do i
[09/07/2012 7:53:49] other: I like kids but it seems like an awful lot of work and time and mess XD
[09/07/2012 7:53:55] other: Hahahaha I assume you mean "father"
[09/07/2012 7:53:59] me: xD
[09/07/2012 7:54:00] other: Not you never want to be a mother :P
[09/07/2012 7:54:03] other: :D
[09/07/2012 7:54:13] me: yeah
[09/07/2012 7:54:20] me: probably not a good idea to become a mother
[09/07/2012 7:54:23] other: Haha
[09/07/2012 7:54:43] me: but being a father... i think i still have plenty of time to make a decision
[09/07/2012 7:54:51] me: but it's not a decision for one so we'll see
[09/07/2012 7:55:02] other: True. I think the same way. Plenty of time.
[09/07/2012 7:55:08] other: I wouldn't want kids too young anyway, if I did want them.
[09/07/2012 7:55:26] me: i don't feel like i'm missing something at all without kids
[09/07/2012 7:55:36] me: just have more time for us :D
[09/07/2012 7:55:47] other: Hahaha :D
[09/07/2012 7:55:48] other: True
